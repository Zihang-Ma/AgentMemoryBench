Making a difference & raising awareness for mental health is super rewarding - I'm really proud of you for taking part!'\nUser: 'Melanie': 'Thanks, Caroline! The event was really thought-provoking.

Taking care of ourselves is so important - even if it's not always easy. Great that you're prioritizing self-care.'\nUser: 'Melanie': 'Yeah, it's tough.

Taking time for yourself is so important. You're doing an awesome job looking after yourself and your family!'\nUser: 'Melanie': 'Thanks, Caroline.
