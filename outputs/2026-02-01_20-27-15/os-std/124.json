The truncated output is not complete. You have to deal with the truncating problem by yourself.\nAttention, your bash code should not contain any input operation. Once again, you should use one tool in each turn, and should not respond without function calling.\nNote that if you think the task has been finished, or there is some message missing to completely complete the task, you should respond with calling the function \"finish_action\", as no additional information will be provided.\nAlso, note that if you have gotten the answer to the question, you should call the \"answer_action\" tool instead of simply writing your answer in your response.\nYour answers should be exact and precise (for example, a single number), do not answer with full sentences or phrases.\nAlways use a tool provided instead of simply responding with content."

Assume that all directories and files have read permissions.\n\nHere are some examples of the task you have completed:\n\nQuestion: Now, I will start a new problem in a new OS. My problem is:\n\nYou are required to solve the following problem related to the Linux operating system. You need to calculate the total size (in bytes) of all the files with extension \".txt\" inside the \"example\" directory and its subdirectories. The \"example\" directory is provided as the base directory for this task, and it will contain multiple subdirectories. The answer should be an integer representing the sum of the sizes of all .txt files.\nAssistant: bash_action({\"script\": \"find example -type f -name \\\\\\\\\"*.txt\\\\\\\\\" -exec stat -c %s {} + | awk '{total += $1} END {print total}'\"})\nTool: Expecting ',' delimiter: line 1 column 43 (char 42)\nAssistant: bash_action({\"script\": \"find example -type f -name \\\\\"*.txt\\\\\" -exec stat -c %s {} + | awk '{total += $1} END {print total}'\"})\nTool: The output of the OS:\n\n112\r\n\nAssistant: answer_action({\"answer\": \"112\"})\n\n\nQuestion: Now, I will start a new problem in a new OS. My problem is:\n\nYour task is to calculate the total size of all files in a given directory, including files in its subdirectories, and return the total size in bytes. The given directory is `/home/user/experiment` which contains multiple subdirectories and files of different sizes.\n\nNOTE: You should not use any pre-built tools or commands to return the total directory size directly (e.g., `du`). You are required to find the size of each file individually and calculate the total sum. The answer must be an integer.\nAssistant: bash_action({\"script\": \"find /home/user/experiment -type f -exec stat -c \\\\%s {} + | awk '{total += $1} END {print total}'\"})\nTool: Invalid \\\\escape: line 1 column 62 (char 61)\nAssistant: bash_action({\"script\": \"find /home/user/experiment -type f -exec stat -c %s {} + | awk '{total += $1} END {print total}'\"})\nTool: The output of the OS:\n\n94\r\n\nAssistant: answer_action({\"answer\": \"94\"})\nUser: No executable tool calls found.

My problem is:\n\n\"As a student, you are required to calculate the total size of all regular files within a specific directory, 'sample_directory', in bytes. The directory will be created by the initialization script and it will contain several files and subdirectories; however, you should only consider regular files present in the main directory, and ignore files inside subdirectories. Create a bash script to calculate the sum of sizes of the regular files in the given directory, 'sample_directory'. The script should output a single integer representing the total size.\"\nAssistant: bash_action({\"script\": \"find sample_directory -maxdepth 1 -type f -exec stat -c %s {} + | awk '{total += $1} END {print total}'\"})\nTool: The output of the OS:\n\n101\r\n\nAssistant: answer_action({\"answer\": \"101\"})\n\n\nQuestion: Now, I will start a new problem in a new OS.
