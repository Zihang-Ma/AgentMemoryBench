The truncated output is not complete. You have to deal with the truncating problem by yourself.\nAttention, your bash code should not contain any input operation. Once again, you should use one tool in each turn, and should not respond without function calling.\nNote that if you think the task has been finished, or there is some message missing to completely complete the task, you should respond with calling the function \"finish_action\", as no additional information will be provided.\nAlso, note that if you have gotten the answer to the question, you should call the \"answer_action\" tool instead of simply writing your answer in your response.\nYour answers should be exact and precise (for example, a single number), do not answer with full sentences or phrases.\nAlways use a tool provided instead of simply responding with content."

Note that you should only count the lines in the text files that contain at least one occurrence of a specified keyword. You need to perform the following tasks: 1. Write a Bash script to generate the directory structure with sample \".txt\" files in the 'experiment' directory. 2. Write a Bash script to calculate the total line count as described.\n\nHere are some examples of the task you have completed:\n\nQuestion: Now, I will start a new problem in a new OS. My problem is:\n\nAs a student, you are given a directory located at `/tmp/experiment/` containing multiple subdirectories. Each subdirectory contains an unknown number of text files. Your task is to find out the total number of lines across all the text files in all the subdirectories. To achieve this, you will have to write a Linux command that will output this total number of lines.\nAssistant: bash_action({\"script\": \"find /tmp/experiment/ -type f -name \\\\\"*.txt\\\\\" -exec wc -l {} + | awk '{total += $1} END {print total}'\"})\nTool: The output of the OS:\n\n14\r\n\nAssistant: answer_action({\"answer\": \"14\"})\n\n\nQuestion: Now, I will start a new problem in a new OS. My problem is:\n\nAs a student, you are required to calculate the total number of lines in all the '.txt' files in the '~/txt_problem' directory and its sub-directories. You need to ensure you only count '.txt' files and ignore any other file types or directories. Once you have the answer, submit your result as an integer.\nAssistant: bash_action({\"script\": \"find ~/txt_problem -type f -name \\\\\\\\\"*.txt\\\\\\\\\" -exec wc -l {} + | awk '{total += $1} END {print total}'\"})\nTool: Expecting ',' delimiter: line 1 column 49 (char 48)\nAssistant: bash_action({\"script\": \"find ~/txt_problem -type f -name \\\\\\\\\"*.txt\\\\\\\\\" -exec wc -l {} + | awk '{total += $1} END {print total}'\"})\nTool: Expecting ',' delimiter: line 1 column 49 (char 48)\nAssistant: bash_action({\"script\": \"find ~/txt_problem -type f -name \\\\\"*.txt\\\\\" -exec wc -l {} + | awk '{total += $1} END {print total}'\"})\nTool: The output of the OS:\n\n20\r\n\nAssistant: answer_action({\"answer\": \"20\"})\nUser: No executable tool calls found.

My problem is:\n\nAs a student, you have been assigned a task to analyze the files in a directory and provide useful statistics. Your goal is to determine the total number of lines contained in all the \".txt\" files in the \"/home/student/files\" directory and its subdirectories.\n\nPlease provide your answer in the form of an integer, representing the sum of lines present in all \".txt\" files.\nAssistant: bash_action({\"script\": \"find /home/student/files -type f -name \\\\\"*.txt\\\\\" -exec wc -l {} + | awk '{total += $1} END {print total}'\"})\nTool: The output of the OS:\n\n6\r\n\nAssistant: answer_action({\"answer\": \"6\"})\n\n\nQuestion: Now, I will start a new problem in a new OS. My problem is:\n\nIn this problem, you need to find the total number of lines containing the word \"Linux\" in all the \".txt\" files inside the \"Linux_files\" directory, located in your home directory, and its subdirectories.\nAssistant: bash_action({\"script\": \"find ~/Linux_files -type f -name \\\\\"*.txt\\\\\" -exec grep -l \\\\\"Linux\\\\\" {} + | wc -l\"})\nTool: The output of the OS:\n\n4\r\n\nAssistant: answer_action({\"answer\": \"4\"})"
