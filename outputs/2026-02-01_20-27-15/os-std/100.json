I will play the role of a Linux (Ubuntu) operating system.\nYour goal is to implement the operations required by me or answer the questions proposed by me.\nFor each of your turns, you should first think about what you should do, and then call exactly one of the provided tools according to the situation.\nIf you think the output is too long, I will truncate it. The truncated output is not complete. You have to deal with the truncating problem by yourself.\nAttention, your bash code should not contain any input operation. Once again, you should use one tool in each turn, and should not respond without function calling.\nNote that if you think the task has been finished, or there is some message missing to completely complete the task, you should respond with calling the function \"finish_action\", as no additional information will be provided.\nAlso, note that if you have gotten the answer to the question, you should call the \"answer_action\" tool instead of simply writing your answer in your response.\nYour answers should be exact and precise (for example, a single number), do not answer with full sentences or phrases.\nAlways use a tool provided instead of simply responding with content."

My problem is:\n\nAs a student, you have been given the task of finding the total number of lines, within a specified set of text files, that contain a specific word. You will write a script using Linux (Ubuntu) shell commands to achieve this task. The specific word and the text files will be provided through an initialization script.\n\nHere are some examples of the task you have completed:\n\nQuestion: Now, I will start a new problem in a new OS. My problem is:\n\nIn this problem, you need to find the total number of lines containing the word \"Linux\" in all the \".txt\" files inside the \"Linux_files\" directory, located in your home directory, and its subdirectories.\nAssistant: bash_action({\"script\": \"find ~/Linux_files -type f -name \\\\\"*.txt\\\\\" -exec grep -l \\\\\"Linux\\\\\" {} + | wc -l\"})\nTool: The output of the OS:\n\n4\r\n\nAssistant: answer_action({\"answer\": \"4\"})\n\n\nQuestion: Now, I will start a new problem in a new OS.

Your goal is to determine the total number of lines contained in all the \".txt\" files in the \"/home/student/files\" directory and its subdirectories.\n\nPlease provide your answer in the form of an integer, representing the sum of lines present in all \".txt\" files.\nAssistant: bash_action({\"script\": \"find /home/student/files -type f -name \\\\\"*.txt\\\\\" -exec wc -l {} + | awk '{total += $1} END {print total}'\"})\nTool: The output of the OS:\n\n6\r\n\nAssistant: answer_action({\"answer\": \"6\"})\n\n\nQuestion: Now, I will start a new problem in a new OS. My problem is:\n\nAs a student, you are given a directory located at `/tmp/experiment/` containing multiple subdirectories. Each subdirectory contains an unknown number of text files. Your task is to find out the total number of lines across all the text files in all the subdirectories. To achieve this, you will have to write a Linux command that will output this total number of lines.\nAssistant: bash_action({\"script\": \"find /tmp/experiment/ -type f -name \\\\\"*.txt\\\\\" -exec wc -l {} + | awk '{total += $1} END {print total}'\"})\nTool: The output of the OS:\n\n14\r\n\nAssistant: answer_action({\"answer\": \"14\"})\n\n\nQuestion: Now, I will start a new problem in a new OS. My problem is:\n\nAs a Linux system administrator, you are tasked with demonstrating your ability to iterate through directories and calculate the total number of files of a specific type.\n\nAssuming you are given a specific file extension (e.g., \".txt\"), count the total number of files with that extension under the \"/home/user/documents\" directory and all its subdirectories. Note that the \"/home/user/documents\" directory could be arbitrarily nested with subdirectories containing no limit to the number of files or other directories.\n\nThe output should be a single integer (the total count of files with the given extension).\nAssistant: bash_action({\"script\": \"find /home/user/documents -type f -name \\\\\"*.txt\\\\\" | wc -l\"})\nTool: The output of the OS:\n\n6\r\n\nAssistant: answer_action({\"answer\": \"6\"})"
