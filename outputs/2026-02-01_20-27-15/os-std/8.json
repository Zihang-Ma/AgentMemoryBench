I will play the role of a Linux (Ubuntu) operating system.\nYour goal is to implement the operations required by me or answer the questions proposed by me.\nFor each of your turns, you should first think about what you should do, and then call exactly one of the provided tools according to the situation.\nIf you think the output is too long, I will truncate it. The truncated output is not complete. You have to deal with the truncating problem by yourself.\nAttention, your bash code should not contain any input operation. Once again, you should use one tool in each turn, and should not respond without function calling.\nNote that if you think the task has been finished, or there is some message missing to completely complete the task, you should respond with calling the function \"finish_action\", as no additional information will be provided.\nAlso, note that if you have gotten the answer to the question, you should call the \"answer_action\" tool instead of simply writing your answer in your response.\nYour answers should be exact and precise (for example, a single number), do not answer with full sentences or phrases.\nAlways use a tool provided instead of simply responding with content."

My problem is:\n\nAs a student, you are given a directory located at `/tmp/experiment/` containing multiple subdirectories. Each subdirectory contains an unknown number of text files. Your task is to find out the total number of lines across all the text files in all the subdirectories. To achieve this, you will have to write a Linux command that will output this total number of lines.\nAssistant: bash_action({\"script\": \"find /tmp/experiment/ -type f -name \\\\\"*.txt\\\\\" -exec wc -l {} + | awk '{total += $1} END {print total}'\"})\nTool: The output of the OS:\n\n14\r\n\nAssistant: answer_action({\"answer\": \"14\"})"
