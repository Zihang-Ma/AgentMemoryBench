I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

Cruzeiro's new data is as follows:\n- Position: 12th\n- Team: Cruzeiro\n- Points: 2\n- Played: 9\n- Drawn: 0 (since they lost 9 games and have only 2 points, it's implied they didn't draw any games)\n- Lost: 9\n- Against: 0 (this is not explicitly mentioned, but it's likely the number of goals they scored against opponents, which we will assume to be 0 for now)\n- Difference: -18\n\nTo solve this, we need to update the existing record for Cruzeiro in the \"League Standings\" table with the new data provided.\n\nI will now execute an SQL query to update the record for Cruzeiro in the \"League Standings\" table.",
