I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

Cruzeiro's current data is as follows:\n- Position: 12th\n- Team: Cruzeiro\n- Points: 2\n- Played: 9\n- Drawn: 0 (since they lost all 9 games)\n- Lost: 9\n- Against: 0 (assuming this is the number of goals scored against them, but it's not specified in the question)\n- Difference: -18\n\nTo update the table, we need to use an SQL `UPDATE` statement. However, since the question does not provide the current values for \"Against\" and \"Drawn,\" we will assume that \"Against\" is the number of goals scored against Cruzeiro, and \"Drawn\" is the number of games they have drawn, which is 0 in this case.\n\nI will now execute an SQL query to update the \"League Standings\" table with the given information for Cruzeiro."
