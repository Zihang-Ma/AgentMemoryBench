I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

To answer this, I will execute a SQL query to calculate the average of the \"Year\" column where the \"Entrant\" is \"Belanger Motors\" and the \"Engine\" is \"Offenhauser L4\".\n\nI will start by writing and executing the SQL query to find the average year.\nTool: [(1956.0,)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"1956.0\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Grand Prix racing results, and the headers of this table are No,Driver,Entrant,Constructor,Chassis,Engine.\nQuestion: Update the Grand Prix racing results with the following information: Driver Charles Leclerc, Entrant Scuderia Ferrari Mission Winnow, Chassis SF21, and Engine Ferrari 065/6 for the record with No. 16.\nAssistant: The question requires updating the record with `No` 16 in the `Grand Prix racing results` table. The specific fields to be updated are `Driver`, `Entrant`, `Chassis`, and `Engine`. This can be achieved by using an `UPDATE` SQL statement that targets the specific row based on the `No` value and sets the new values for the specified columns.\n\nI will now write and execute the SQL query to perform the update.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Grand Prix racing results` SET Driver = 'Charles Leclerc', Entrant = 'Scuderia Ferrari Mission Winnow', Chassis = 'SF21', Engine = 'Ferrari 065/6' WHERE No = 16;\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The record with No. 16 in the Grand Prix racing results table has been successfully updated with the provided information.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Formula 1 Race Results, and the headers of this table are Driver,Constructor,Laps,Time/Retired,Grid.\nQuestion: Modify the 'Time/Retired' column to '+1:30.763' where the 'Driver' column is 'Lewis Hamilton' in the 'Formula 1 Race Results' table.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Formula 1 Race Results` SET `Time/Retired` = '+1:30.763' WHERE Driver = 'Lewis Hamilton';\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The 'Time/Retired' column for 'Lewis Hamilton' has been successfully updated to '+1:30.763' in the 'Formula 1 Race Results' table.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Jiu-Jitsu Championships Results, and the headers of this table are Result,Opponent,Method,Event,Notes.\nQuestion: What are the Notes when the Method is decision?\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Notes` FROM `Jiu-Jitsu Championships Results` WHERE `Method` = 'decision';\"}) The question is asking for the Notes from the \"Jiu-Jitsu Championships Results\" table where the Method is \"decision\".
