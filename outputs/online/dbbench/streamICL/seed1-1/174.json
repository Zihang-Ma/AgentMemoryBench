I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

No specific notes are given in the actress_filmography table.\n\n\nHere are some examples of the task you have completed:\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Filmography, and the headers of this table are Year,Title,Role,Notes.\nQuestion: Set the Notes column to 'Released' and the Role column to 'Todd' for the rows where the Title column is 'Chaos Walking' in the Filmography table.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Filmography` SET `Notes` = 'Released', `Role` = 'Todd' WHERE `Title` = 'Chaos Walking';\"}) To update the `Notes` column to `'Released'` and the `Role` column to `'Todd'` for the rows where the `Title` column is `'Chaos Walking'` in the `Filmography` table, we will use the `UPDATE` command in SQL. This command allows us to modify specific rows in a table based on a condition.\n\nThe SQL query will be:\n```sql\nUPDATE `Filmography` SET `Notes` = 'Released', `Role` = 'Todd' WHERE `Title` = 'Chaos Walking';\n```\n\nThis query sets the `Notes` and `Role` columns for all rows where the `Title` is `'Chaos Walking'`.\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The 'Notes' column and 'Role' column for 'Chaos Walking' have been successfully updated to 'Released' and 'Todd' respectively in the 'Filmography' table.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Movie_Credits, and the headers of this table are Year,Title,Role,Notes.\nQuestion: The Movie_Credits table is being inserted with the value of Year, Title, Role, and Notes, with values of '2019', 'Joker', 'Arthur Fleck/Joker', and 'Academy Award winning performance for Best Actor', respectively.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `Movie_Credits` (Year, Title, Role, Notes) VALUES ('2019', 'Joker', 'Arthur Fleck/Joker', 'Academy Award winning performance for Best Actor');\"}) The question involves inserting a new row into the `Movie_Credits` table with the values `'2019'`, `'Joker'`, `'Arthur Fleck/Joker'`, and `'Academy Award winning performance for Best Actor'` for the columns `Year`, `Title`, `Role`, and `Notes`, respectively. To perform this operation, we will use the `INSERT INTO` command in SQL.\n\nThe SQL query will be:\n```sql\nINSERT INTO `Movie_Credits` (Year, Title, Role, Notes) VALUES ('2019', 'Joker', 'Arthur Fleck/Joker', 'Academy Award winning performance for Best Actor');\n```\n\nThis query adds the specified values as a new row to the `Movie_Credits` table.\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"('2019', 'Joker', 'Arthur Fleck/Joker', 'Academy Award winning performance for Best Actor') has been successfully added to the 'Movie_Credits' table.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is filmography, and the headers of this table are Year,Film,Role,Language,Notes.\nQuestion: Set notes to '-' for old films before 2010 in the filmography table.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `filmography` SET `Notes` = '-' WHERE `Year` < 2010;\"}) To set the `Notes` column to `'-'` for all films in the `filmography` table that were released before 2010, we will use the `UPDATE` command in SQL. This command allows us to modify specific rows in a table based on a condition.\n\nThe SQL query will be:\n```sql\nUPDATE `filmography` SET `Notes` = '-' WHERE `Year` < 2010;\n```\n\nThis query sets the `Notes` column to `'-'` for all rows where the `Year` is less than 2010.\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The 'Notes' column for old films before 2010 in the 'filmography' table has been successfully set to '-'.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is athletic_achievements, and the headers of this table are Year,Competition,Venue,Position,Event,Notes.\nQuestion: In 2023, the athlete won the first place in the Half Marathon event at the Commonwealth Games held in Birmingham, United Kingdom.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `athletic_achievements` (Year, Competition, Venue, Position, Event, Notes) VALUES ('2023', 'Commonwealth Games', 'Birmingham, United Kingdom', '1st', 'Half Marathon', '');\"}) The question requires inserting a new row into the `athletic_achievements` table with the specified values: Year is '2023', Competition is 'Commonwealth Games', Venue is 'Birmingham, United Kingdom', Position is '1st', Event is 'Half Marathon', and Notes is empty or not provided. This can be achieved by using an `INSERT INTO` SQL statement with the provided values.\n\nI will now execute the SQL query to insert the new row.\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The new row with values ('2023', 'Commonwealth Games', 'Birmingham, United Kingdom', '1st', 'Half Marathon', '') has been successfully inserted into the 'athletic_achievements' table.\"]})"
