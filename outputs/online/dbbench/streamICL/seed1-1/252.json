I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

To answer this, I will execute a SQL query to retrieve the \"Game\" column from the \"game score\" table where the \"Score\" is '108-85' and order the results by the \"Score\" in ascending order, then limit the result to 1 to get the lowest game.\nTool: [('80',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"80\"]}) The SQL query executed successfully and returned the result. The lowest game with a score of 108-85 is game number 80.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Basketball Players, and the headers of this table are No,Player,Height,Position,Year born,Current Club.\nQuestion: What is the earliest any of these players were born?\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT MIN(`Year born`) FROM `Basketball Players`;\"}) The question is asking for the earliest year any of the players in the \"Basketball Players\" table were born. To find this, I will execute a SQL query to retrieve the minimum value of the \"Year born\" column.\nTool: [('1976',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"1976\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Athlete Performances, and the headers of this table are Year,Competition,Venue,Position,Event,Notes.\nQuestion: Insert a record into the table 'Athlete Performances' with the values '1996' for the year, 'Olympic Games' for the competition, 'Atlanta, USA' for the venue, '1st' for the position, 'Decathlon' for the event, and '8893 pts' for the notes.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `Athlete Performances` (Year, Competition, Venue, Position, Event, Notes) VALUES ('1996', 'Olympic Games', 'Atlanta, USA', '1st', 'Decathlon', '8893 pts');\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The record ('1996', 'Olympic Games', 'Atlanta, USA', '1st', 'Decathlon', '8893 pts') has been successfully inserted into the 'Athlete Performances' table.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is game_results, and the headers of this table are Date,Opponent,Score,Loss,Attendance,Record.\nQuestion: On June 2, the team played against the Red Sox, with a final score of 3-2. The team suffered a loss, with Cotton having a record of 3-3. The game had an attendance of 30,000, bringing the team's overall record to 30-27. The game results were inserted into the database using the following values: Date='June 2', Opponent='Red Sox', Score='3 - 2', Loss='Cotton (3-3)', Attendance='30,000', and Record='30-27'.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `game_results` (Date, Opponent, Score, Loss, Attendance, Record) VALUES ('June 2', 'Red Sox', '3 - 2', 'Cotton (3-3)', '30,000', '30-27');\"}) The task is to insert a new record into the \"game_results\" table with the specified values: Date = \"June 2\", Opponent = \"Red Sox\", Score = \"3 - 2\", Loss = \"Cotton (3-3)\", Attendance = \"30,000\", and Record = \"30-27\". \n\nTo accomplish this, I will use the `execute_sql` function to run an `INSERT` query with the given values.\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The record ('June 2', 'Red Sox', '3 - 2', 'Cotton (3-3)', '30,000', '30-27') has been successfully inserted into the 'game_results' table.\"]})"
