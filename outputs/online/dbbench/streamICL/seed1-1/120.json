I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

      "content": "Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Smooth Muscle Cell Activation Table, and the headers of this table are Cell type,Organ/system,Activators ligands -- > G q - GPCRs,Effects.\nQuestion: To record the activation of smooth muscle cells, the data of 'Cell type', 'Organ/system', 'Activators ligands --> Gq-GPCRs', and 'Effects' were inserted into 'Smooth Muscle Cell Activation Table' with the information of platelets in the circulatory system being activated by the ligand prostaglandin E2, which inhibits aggregation.\n\n\nHere are some examples of the task you have completed:\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Jiu-Jitsu Championships Results, and the headers of this table are Result,Opponent,Method,Event,Notes.\nQuestion: What are the Notes when the Method is decision?\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Notes` FROM `Jiu-Jitsu Championships Results` WHERE `Method` = 'decision';\"}) The question is asking for the Notes from the \"Jiu-Jitsu Championships Results\" table where the Method is \"decision\". To answer this, I will execute a SQL query to retrieve the \"Notes\" column from the \"Jiu-Jitsu Championships Results\" table where the \"Method\" is \"decision\".\nTool: [('Women +60kg Bronze',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Women +60kg Bronze\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Motorcycle Race Results, and the headers of this table are Rider,Manufacturer,Laps,Time/Retired,Grid.\nQuestion: What is the average number of laps with an accident time/retired, aprilia manufacturer and a grid of 27?\nAssistant: The question requires calculating the average number of laps for entries in the \"Motorcycle Race Results\" table where the manufacturer is \"Aprilia\" and the grid is 27. This can be achieved by using a `SELECT` SQL statement that filters the rows based on the specified conditions and calculates the average of the \"Laps\" column.\n\nI will now write and execute the SQL query to retrieve the required information.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT AVG(Laps) FROM `Motorcycle Race Results` WHERE Manufacturer = 'Aprilia' AND Grid = 27;\"})\nTool: [(12.0,)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"12.0\"]}) The average number of laps for entries with an \"Aprilia\" manufacturer and a grid of 27 is 12.0. I will now commit this as the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Table of Year, Title, and Role, and the headers of this table are Year,Title,Role.\nQuestion: Add ('2019', 'Aoharu Ride', 'Kou Mabuchi') to the 'Table of Year, Title, and Role' table through INSERT INTO command.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `Table of Year, Title, and Role` (Year, Title, Role) VALUES ('2019', 'Aoharu Ride', 'Kou Mabuchi');\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"('2019', 'Aoharu Ride', 'Kou Mabuchi') has been successfully added to the 'Table of Year, Title, and Role' table.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Racing Stats, and the headers of this table are Year,Starts,Wins,Top 5,Top 10,Poles,Avg. Start,Avg. Finish,Winnings,Position,Team(s).\nQuestion: Name the avg finish for position of 70th\nAssistant: The question requires retrieving the average finish (`Avg. Finish`) for the position of 70th from the `Racing Stats` table. This can be achieved by using a `SELECT` SQL statement that filters the rows where the `Position` is 70th and selects the `Avg. Finish` column.\n\nI will now write and execute the SQL query to retrieve the required information.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Avg. Finish` FROM `Racing Stats` WHERE Position = '70th';\"})\nTool: [('36.0',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": ['36.0']})\nTool: Error: Failed to parse tool call.
