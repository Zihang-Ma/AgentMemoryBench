I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

To accomplish this, I will execute an `UPDATE` SQL query to change the 'Runs' column for the row where the 'Player' column is 'Tom Smith'.\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The 'Runs' attribute for 'Tom Smith' has been successfully set to 200 in the 'CricketPlayers' table.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is football_standings, and the headers of this table are Position,Club,Games played,Wins,Draws,Loses,Goals scored,Goals conceded,Points.\nQuestion: What is the fewest number of games played?\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT MIN(`Games played`) FROM `football_standings`;\"}) The question is asking for the fewest number of games played in the \"football_standings\" table. To answer this, I will execute a SQL query to retrieve the minimum value from the \"Games played\" column in the \"football_standings\" table.\nTool: [('34',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"34\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is game score, and the headers of this table are Game,Date,Opponent,Score,Location,Record.\nQuestion: Score of 108-85 is what lowest game?\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Game` FROM `game score` WHERE `Score` = '108-85' ORDER BY `Score` ASC LIMIT 1;\"}) The question is asking for the game with the lowest score of 108-85 in the \"game score\" table. To answer this, I will execute a SQL query to retrieve the \"Game\" column from the \"game score\" table where the \"Score\" is '108-85' and order the results by the \"Score\" in ascending order, then limit the result to 1 to get the lowest game.\nTool: [('80',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"80\"]}) The SQL query executed successfully and returned the result. The lowest game with a score of 108-85 is game number 80.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Racing Stats, and the headers of this table are Year,Starts,Wins,Top 5,Top 10,Poles,Avg. Start,Avg. Finish,Winnings,Position,Team(s).\nQuestion: Name the avg finish for position of 70th\nAssistant: The question requires retrieving the average finish (`Avg. Finish`) for the position of 70th from the `Racing Stats` table. This can be achieved by using a `SELECT` SQL statement that filters the rows where the `Position` is 70th and selects the `Avg. Finish` column.\n\nI will now write and execute the SQL query to retrieve the required information.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Avg. Finish` FROM `Racing Stats` WHERE Position = '70th';\"})\nTool: [('36.0',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": ['36.0']})\nTool: Error: Failed to parse tool call.
