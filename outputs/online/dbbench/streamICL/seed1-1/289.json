I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

This command allows us to modify specific rows in a table based on a condition.\n\nThe SQL query will be:\n```sql\nUPDATE `filmography` SET `Notes` = '-' WHERE `Year` < 2010;\n```\n\nThis query sets the `Notes` column to `'-'` for all rows where the `Year` is less than 2010.\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The 'Notes' column for old films before 2010 in the 'filmography' table has been successfully set to '-'.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Actress_Filmography, and the headers of this table are Year,Title,Role,Notes.\nQuestion: In the Actress_Filmography, update the record where Notes are set to '-' and change the Year to '2008', Title to 'Sorority House Massacre 2', Role to 'Hannah', and Notes to 'Video'.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Actress_Filmography` SET `Year` = '2008', `Title` = 'Sorority House Massacre 2', `Role` = 'Hannah', `Notes` = 'Video' WHERE `Notes` = '-';\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The record where Notes are set to '-' in the Actress_Filmography table has been successfully updated with Year '2008', Title 'Sorority House Massacre 2', Role 'Hannah', and Notes 'Video'.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Winners By Country, and the headers of this table are Winner,Country,Most Recent Win.\nQuestion: The `Winners By Country` table is being updated by adding the values '3' for `Winner`, 'Spain' for `Country`, and '2005' for `Most Recent Win`.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `Winners By Country` (Winner, Country, Most Recent Win) VALUES ('3', 'Spain', '2005');\"}) The question requires inserting a new row into the `Winners By Country` table with the specified values: `Winner` is '3', `Country` is 'Spain', and `Most Recent Win` is '2005'.
