To perform this operation, we will use the `INSERT INTO` command in SQL.\n\nThe SQL query will be:\n```sql\nINSERT INTO `Movie_Credits` (Year, Title, Role, Notes) VALUES ('2019', 'Joker', 'Arthur Fleck/Joker', 'Academy Award winning performance for Best Actor');\n```\n\nThis query adds the specified values as a new row to the `Movie_Credits` table.\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"('2019', 'Joker', 'Arthur Fleck/Joker', 'Academy Award winning performance for Best Actor') has been successfully added to the 'Movie_Credits' table.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Filmography, and the headers of this table are Year,Title,Role,Notes.\nQuestion: Set the Notes column to 'Released' and the Role column to 'Todd' for the rows where the Title column is 'Chaos Walking' in the Filmography table.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Filmography` SET `Notes` = 'Released', `Role` = 'Todd' WHERE `Title` = 'Chaos Walking';\"}) To update the `Notes` column to `'Released'` and the `Role` column to `'Todd'` for the rows where the `Title` column is `'Chaos Walking'` in the `Filmography` table, we will use the `UPDATE` command in SQL. This command allows us to modify specific rows in a table based on a condition.\n\nThe SQL query will be:\n```sql\nUPDATE `Filmography` SET `Notes` = 'Released', `Role` = 'Todd' WHERE `Title` = 'Chaos Walking';\n```\n\nThis query sets the `Notes` and `Role` columns for all rows where the `Title` is `'Chaos Walking'`.\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The 'Notes' column and 'Role' column for 'Chaos Walking' have been successfully updated to 'Released' and 'Todd' respectively in the 'Filmography' table.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is filmography, and the headers of this table are Year,Film,Role,Language,Notes.\nQuestion: Set notes to '-' for old films before 2010 in the filmography table.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `filmography` SET `Notes` = '-' WHERE `Year` < 2010;\"}) To set the `Notes` column to `'-'` for all films in the `filmography` table that were released before 2010, we will use the `UPDATE` command in SQL. This command allows us to modify specific rows in a table based on a condition.\n\nThe SQL query will be:\n```sql\nUPDATE `filmography` SET `Notes` = '-' WHERE `Year` < 2010;\n```\n\nThis query sets the `Notes` column to `'-'` for all rows where the `Year` is less than 2010.\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The 'Notes' column for old films before 2010 in the 'filmography' table has been successfully set to '-'.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Table of Year, Title, and Role, and the headers of this table are Year,Title,Role.\nQuestion: Add ('2019', 'Aoharu Ride', 'Kou Mabuchi') to the 'Table of Year, Title, and Role' table through INSERT INTO command.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `Table of Year, Title, and Role` (Year, Title, Role) VALUES ('2019', 'Aoharu Ride', 'Kou Mabuchi');\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"('2019', 'Aoharu Ride', 'Kou Mabuchi') has been successfully added to the 'Table of Year, Title, and Role' table.\"]})"
