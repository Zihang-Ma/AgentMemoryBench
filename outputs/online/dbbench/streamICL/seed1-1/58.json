      "content": "Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Grand Prix Result, and the headers of this table are Pos,Driver,Entrant,Constructor,Time/Retired,Grid.\nQuestion: who came in earlier, tony maggs or jo siffert?\n\n\nHere are some examples of the task you have completed:\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is 1952_British_Grand_Prix_0, and the headers of this table are Pos,No,Driver,Constructor,Time,Gap.\nQuestion: The 1952 British Grand Prix saw Tony Gaze finish 22nd in his HWM - Alta with a time of 2:02, trailing the winner by 12 seconds. The INSERT INTO query for this data would be: INSERT INTO 1952_British_Grand_Prix_0 (Pos, No, Driver, Constructor, Time, Gap) VALUES (22, 2, 'Tony Gaze', 'HWM - Alta', '2:02', '+12');\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `1952_British_Grand_Prix_0` (Pos, No, Driver, Constructor, Time, Gap) VALUES (22, 2, 'Tony Gaze', 'HWM - Alta', '2:02', '+12');\"}) The question provides an `INSERT INTO` query for the `1952_British_Grand_Prix_0` table, which includes the data for Tony Gaze finishing 22nd with a time of 2:02 and a gap of +12 seconds. This query is already valid and can be executed directly to insert the specified record into the table.\n\nI will now execute the provided `INSERT INTO` query to insert the record into the `1952_British_Grand_Prix_0` table.\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The record (22, 2, 'Tony Gaze', 'HWM - Alta', '2:02', '+12') has been successfully inserted into the '1952_British_Grand_Prix_0' table.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Grand Prix racing results, and the headers of this table are No,Driver,Entrant,Constructor,Chassis,Engine.\nQuestion: Update the Grand Prix racing results with the following information: Driver Charles Leclerc, Entrant Scuderia Ferrari Mission Winnow, Chassis SF21, and Engine Ferrari 065/6 for the record with No. 16.\nAssistant: The question requires updating the record with `No` 16 in the `Grand Prix racing results` table. The specific fields to be updated are `Driver`, `Entrant`, `Chassis`, and `Engine`. This can be achieved by using an `UPDATE` SQL statement that targets the specific row based on the `No` value and sets the new values for the specified columns.\n\nI will now write and execute the SQL query to perform the update.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Grand Prix racing results` SET Driver = 'Charles Leclerc', Entrant = 'Scuderia Ferrari Mission Winnow', Chassis = 'SF21', Engine = 'Ferrari 065/6' WHERE No = 16;\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The record with No. 16 in the Grand Prix racing results table has been successfully updated with the provided information.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Formula 1 Race Results, and the headers of this table are Driver,Constructor,Laps,Time/Retired,Grid.\nQuestion: Modify the 'Time/Retired' column to '+1:30.763' where the 'Driver' column is 'Lewis Hamilton' in the 'Formula 1 Race Results' table.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Formula 1 Race Results` SET `Time/Retired` = '+1:30.763' WHERE Driver = 'Lewis Hamilton';\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The 'Time/Retired' column for 'Lewis Hamilton' has been successfully updated to '+1:30.763' in the 'Formula 1 Race Results' table.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Racing Stats, and the headers of this table are Year,Starts,Wins,Top 5,Top 10,Poles,Avg. Start,Avg. Finish,Winnings,Position,Team(s).\nQuestion: Name the avg finish for position of 70th\nAssistant: The question requires retrieving the average finish (`Avg. Finish`) for the position of 70th from the `Racing Stats` table. This can be achieved by using a `SELECT` SQL statement that filters the rows where the `Position` is 70th and selects the `Avg. Finish` column.\n\nI will now write and execute the SQL query to retrieve the required information.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Avg. Finish` FROM `Racing Stats` WHERE Position = '70th';\"})\nTool: [('36.0',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": ['36.0']})\nTool: Error: Failed to parse tool call.
