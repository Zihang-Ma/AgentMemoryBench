I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

This can be achieved by using an `INSERT INTO` SQL statement with the provided values.\nTool: 1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near 'Recent Win) VALUES ('3', 'Spain', '2005')' at line 1\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `Winners By Country` (Winner, Country, `Most Recent Win`) VALUES ('3', 'Spain', '2005');\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The new row with values ('3', 'Spain', '2005') has been successfully inserted into the 'Winners By Country' table.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Football Matches, and the headers of this table are Tie no,Home team,Score,Away team,Attendance.\nQuestion: How many attended tie number 19?\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Attendance` FROM `Football Matches` WHERE `Tie no` = 19;\"}) The question is asking for the attendance number of tie number 19 in the \"Football Matches\" table.

This command allows us to modify specific rows in a table based on a condition.\n\nThe SQL query will be:\n```sql\nUPDATE `filmography` SET `Notes` = '-' WHERE `Year` < 2010;\n```\n\nThis query sets the `Notes` column to `'-'` for all rows where the `Year` is less than 2010.\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The 'Notes' column for old films before 2010 in the 'filmography' table has been successfully set to '-'.\"]})"
