I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

Start,Avg. Finish,Winnings,Position,Team(s).\nQuestion: Name the avg finish for position of 70th\nAssistant: The question requires retrieving the average finish (`Avg. Finish`) for the position of 70th from the `Racing Stats` table. This can be achieved by using a `SELECT` SQL statement that filters the rows where the `Position` is 70th and selects the `Avg. Finish` column.\n\nI will now write and execute the SQL query to retrieve the required information.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Avg.

This can be achieved by using an `INSERT INTO` SQL statement with the provided values.\n\nI will now execute the SQL query to insert the new row.\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The record ('2012', 'Olympic Games', 'London, UK', '12th', 'Pole vault', '5.50 m') has been successfully inserted into the 'Athlete Results' table.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is CricketPlayers, and the headers of this table are Player,Matches,Innings,Runs,Average,100s,50s.\nQuestion: Set the 'Runs' attribute to 200 in the 'CricketPlayers' table for the player with the name 'Tom Smith'.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `CricketPlayers` SET `Runs` = 200 WHERE `Player` = 'Tom Smith';\"}) The question is asking to update the 'Runs' attribute to 200 in the 'CricketPlayers' table for the player with the name 'Tom Smith'. To accomplish this, I will execute an `UPDATE` SQL query to change the 'Runs' column for the row where the 'Player' column is 'Tom Smith'.\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The 'Runs' attribute for 'Tom Smith' has been successfully set to 200 in the 'CricketPlayers' table.\"]})"
