I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

Start,Avg. Finish,Winnings,Position,Team(s).\nQuestion: Name the avg finish for position of 70th\nAssistant: The question requires retrieving the average finish (`Avg. Finish`) for the position of 70th from the `Racing Stats` table. This can be achieved by using a `SELECT` SQL statement that filters the rows where the `Position` is 70th and selects the `Avg. Finish` column.\n\nI will now write and execute the SQL query to retrieve the required information.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Avg. Finish` FROM `Racing Stats` WHERE Position = '70th';\"})\nTool: [('36.0',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": ['36.0']})\nTool: Error: Failed to parse tool call. Tool call format is incorrect.\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"36.0\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is racers_database, and the headers of this table are Year,Entrant,Chassis,Engine,Points.\nQuestion: What is the average year that the Belanger Motors had an Offenhauser l4 engine?\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT AVG(Year) FROM racers_database WHERE Entrant = 'Belanger Motors' AND Engine = 'Offenhauser L4';\"}) The question is asking for the average year in which \"Belanger Motors\" had an \"Offenhauser L4\" engine in the \"racers_database\" table. To answer this, I will execute a SQL query to calculate the average of the \"Year\" column where the \"Entrant\" is \"Belanger Motors\" and the \"Engine\" is \"Offenhauser L4\".\n\nI will start by writing and executing the SQL query to find the average year.\nTool: [(1956.0,)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"1956.0\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Jiu-Jitsu Championships Results, and the headers of this table are Result,Opponent,Method,Event,Notes.\nQuestion: What are the Notes when the Method is decision?\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Notes` FROM `Jiu-Jitsu Championships Results` WHERE `Method` = 'decision';\"}) The question is asking for the Notes from the \"Jiu-Jitsu Championships Results\" table where the Method is \"decision\". To answer this, I will execute a SQL query to retrieve the \"Notes\" column from the \"Jiu-Jitsu Championships Results\" table where the \"Method\" is \"decision\".\nTool: [('Women +60kg Bronze',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Women +60kg Bronze\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Race_Results, and the headers of this table are Rider,Bike,Laps,Time,Grid.\nQuestion: Set the bike as Yamaha YZF-R1 in the race results table where the rider is Chaz Davies.\nAssistant: The question requires updating the `Bike` column in the `Race_Results` table to 'Yamaha YZF-R1' for the record where the `Rider` is 'Chaz Davies'. This can be achieved by using an `UPDATE` SQL statement that targets the specific row based on the `Rider` value and sets the new value for the `Bike` column.\n\nI will now write and execute the SQL query to perform the update.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Race_Results` SET `Bike` = 'Yamaha YZF-R1' WHERE `Rider` = 'Chaz Davies';\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The bike for Chaz Davies in the Race_Results table has been successfully set to 'Yamaha YZF-R1'.\"]})"
