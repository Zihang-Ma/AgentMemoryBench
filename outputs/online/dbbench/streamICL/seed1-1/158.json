Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer.

Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

This can be achieved by using an `INSERT INTO` SQL statement with the provided values.\nTool: 1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near 'Recent Win) VALUES ('3', 'Spain', '2005')' at line 1\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `Winners By Country` (Winner, Country, `Most Recent Win`) VALUES ('3', 'Spain', '2005');\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The new row with values ('3', 'Spain', '2005') has been successfully inserted into the 'Winners By Country' table.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Racing Stats, and the headers of this table are Year,Starts,Wins,Top 5,Top 10,Poles,Avg. Start,Avg. Finish,Winnings,Position,Team(s).\nQuestion: Name the avg finish for position of 70th\nAssistant: The question requires retrieving the average finish (`Avg. Finish`) for the position of 70th from the `Racing Stats` table. This can be achieved by using a `SELECT` SQL statement that filters the rows where the `Position` is 70th and selects the `Avg. Finish` column.\n\nI will now write and execute the SQL query to retrieve the required information.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Avg.

The specific fields to be updated are `Driver`, `Entrant`, `Chassis`, and `Engine`. This can be achieved by using an `UPDATE` SQL statement that targets the specific row based on the `No` value and sets the new values for the specified columns.\n\nI will now write and execute the SQL query to perform the update.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Grand Prix racing results` SET Driver = 'Charles Leclerc', Entrant = 'Scuderia Ferrari Mission Winnow', Chassis = 'SF21', Engine = 'Ferrari 065/6' WHERE No = 16;\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The record with No. 16 in the Grand Prix racing results table has been successfully updated with the provided information.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is racing_career, and the headers of this table are Season,Series,Races,Wins,Podiums,Points,Final Placing.\nQuestion: Update the racing career table to set the series to 'Formula Two', races to '2', wins to '1', podiums to '2', points to '45', and final placing to '1st' where the season is '2017'.\nAssistant: The question requires updating multiple columns in the `racing_career` table where the `Season` is '2017'. The columns to be updated are `Series`, `Races`, `Wins`, `Podiums`, `Points`, and `Final Placing`. This can be achieved by using an `UPDATE` SQL statement that targets the specific row based on the `Season` value and sets the new values for the respective columns.\n\nI will now write and execute the SQL query to perform the update.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `racing_career` SET Series = 'Formula Two', Races = '2', Wins = '1', Podiums = '2', Points = '45', `Final Placing` = '1st' WHERE Season = '2017';\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The racing career table has been successfully updated with the new values for the season '2017'.\"]})"
