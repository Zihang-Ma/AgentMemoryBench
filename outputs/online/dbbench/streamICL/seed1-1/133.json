I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

To answer this, I will execute a SQL query to calculate the average of the \"Year\" column where the \"Entrant\" is \"Belanger Motors\" and the \"Engine\" is \"Offenhauser L4\".\n\nI will start by writing and executing the SQL query to find the average year.\nTool: [(1956.0,)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"1956.0\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Racing Stats, and the headers of this table are Year,Starts,Wins,Top 5,Top 10,Poles,Avg. Start,Avg. Finish,Winnings,Position,Team(s).\nQuestion: Name the avg finish for position of 70th\nAssistant: The question requires retrieving the average finish (`Avg. Finish`) for the position of 70th from the `Racing Stats` table. This can be achieved by using a `SELECT` SQL statement that filters the rows where the `Position` is 70th and selects the `Avg. Finish` column.\n\nI will now write and execute the SQL query to retrieve the required information.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Avg. Finish` FROM `Racing Stats` WHERE Position = '70th';\"})\nTool: [('36.0',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": ['36.0']})\nTool: Error: Failed to parse tool call. Tool call format is incorrect.\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"36.0\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Game Records, and the headers of this table are Game,November,Opponent,Score,Record,Points.\nQuestion: Change the opponent value to 'New York Rangers' for the game with number '30' in the 'Game Records' table.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Game Records` SET `Opponent` = 'New York Rangers' WHERE `Game` = 30;\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The opponent value for the game with number 30 in the 'Game Records' table has been successfully updated to 'New York Rangers'.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is hockey_players, and the headers of this table are Pick #,Player,Nationality,Position,Team from,League from.\nQuestion: What is the total pick # for the D position from a team from Chilliwack Bruins?\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT SUM(`Pick #`) FROM `hockey_players` WHERE `Position` = 'D' AND `Team from` = 'Chilliwack Bruins';\"}) The question is asking for the total pick # for players in the D position from the team \"Chilliwack Bruins\" in the `hockey_players` table. To answer this, I will execute a SQL query to sum the \"Pick #\" column for all rows where the \"Position\" is \"D\" and the \"Team from\" is \"Chilliwack Bruins\".\nTool: [(167.0,)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"167\"]})"

Since the task is about confirming the insertion or retrieving specific data, I will assume the question is to confirm the insertion or retrieve the details of the locomotive with number 36001.\n\nI will now write and execute the SQL query to retrieve the details of the locomotive with number 36001.",
