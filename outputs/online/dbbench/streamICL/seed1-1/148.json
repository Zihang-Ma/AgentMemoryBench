To perform this operation, we will use the `INSERT INTO` command in SQL.\n\nThe SQL query will be:\n```sql\nINSERT INTO `Movie_Credits` (Year, Title, Role, Notes) VALUES ('2019', 'Joker', 'Arthur Fleck/Joker', 'Academy Award winning performance for Best Actor');\n```\n\nThis query adds the specified values as a new row to the `Movie_Credits` table.\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"('2019', 'Joker', 'Arthur Fleck/Joker', 'Academy Award winning performance for Best Actor') has been successfully added to the 'Movie_Credits' table.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Winners By Country, and the headers of this table are Winner,Country,Most Recent Win.\nQuestion: The `Winners By Country` table is being updated by adding the values '3' for `Winner`, 'Spain' for `Country`, and '2005' for `Most Recent Win`.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `Winners By Country` (Winner, Country, Most Recent Win) VALUES ('3', 'Spain', '2005');\"}) The question requires inserting a new row into the `Winners By Country` table with the specified values: `Winner` is '3', `Country` is 'Spain', and `Most Recent Win` is '2005'.
