I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

This is likely due to the use of a reserved keyword (`Rank`) as a column name without proper escaping. In MySQL, if a column name is a reserved keyword, it should be enclosed in backticks to avoid syntax errors.\n\nI will correct the SQL query by properly escaping the `Rank` column with backticks and re-execute it.\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The total points of the figure skating competitor ranked 22 in the 'Figure Skating Competitors' table have been successfully updated to 195.67.\"]})"
