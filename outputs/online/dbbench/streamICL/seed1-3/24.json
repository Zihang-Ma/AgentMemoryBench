I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

This can be done using the `ORDER BY` clause with `DESC` to sort the players by the number of titles in descending order and then selecting the top result using `LIMIT 1`.\n\nI will now execute the SQL query to find the player with the highest number of titles.\nTool: [('Jansher Khan',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Jansher Khan\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Football Matches, and the headers of this table are Tie no,Home team,Score,Away team,Attendance.\nQuestion: How many attended tie number 19?\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Attendance FROM `Football Matches` WHERE `Tie no` = 19;\"}) The question is asking for the attendance number of tie number 19 in the \"Football Matches\" table. To answer this, I need to query the \"Attendance\" column for the row where \"Tie no\" is 19.\n\nI will now execute the SQL query to retrieve the required information.\nTool: [('1,174',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"1,174\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is player_recruitment, and the headers of this table are Round,Pick,Player,Recruited from,Club.\nQuestion: Change the club of the player recruitment with pick number 21 to Geelong in the update statement.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `player_recruitment` SET Club = 'Geelong' WHERE Pick = 21;\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The club of the player recruitment with pick number 21 has been successfully changed to Geelong in the player_recruitment table.\"]})"
