I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

This can be done using the `ORDER BY` clause with `DESC` to sort the players by the number of titles in descending order and then selecting the top result using `LIMIT 1`.\n\nI will now execute the SQL query to find the player with the highest number of titles.\nTool: [('Jansher Khan',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Jansher Khan\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Winners By Country, and the headers of this table are Winner,Country,Most Recent Win.\nQuestion: The `Winners By Country` table is being updated by adding the values '3' for `Winner`, 'Spain' for `Country`, and '2005' for `Most Recent Win`.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `Winners By Country` (Winner, Country, Most Recent Win) VALUES ('3', 'Spain', '2005');\"})\nTool: 1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near 'Recent Win) VALUES ('3', 'Spain', '2005')' at line 1\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `Winners By Country` (Winner, Country, `Most Recent Win`) VALUES ('3', 'Spain', '2005');\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The values '3' for Winner, 'Spain' for Country, and '2005' for Most Recent Win have been successfully added to the Winners By Country table.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is game score, and the headers of this table are Game,Date,Opponent,Score,Location,Record.\nQuestion: Score of 108-85 is what lowest game?\nAssistant: The question is asking for the lowest game (i.e., the game with the smallest \"Game\" value) that has a score of \"108-85\" in the `game score` table.
