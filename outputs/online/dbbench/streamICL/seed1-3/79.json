I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

To find this, I need to query the `Aerial Tramway Table` for records where the `Country` is 'Germany', sort them by `Year built` in descending order, and then select the top result. This will give the most recent year a pylon was built in Germany.\n\nI will now execute the SQL query to retrieve the required information.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Year built` FROM `Aerial Tramway Table` WHERE Country = 'Germany' ORDER BY `Year built` DESC LIMIT 1;\"})\nTool: [('1970',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"1970\"]})\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"1970\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Location Listing, and the headers of this table are Name,Location,City,Listing date.\nQuestion: The `Location Listing` includes the `Name` 'Central Park', the `Location` '59th to 110th Street', the `City` 'New York City', and the `Listing date` 'July 21, 1858'.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `Location Listing` (Name, Location, City, `Listing date`) VALUES ('Central Park', '59th to 110th Street', 'New York City', 'July 21, 1858');\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The information for Central Park has been successfully inserted into the Location Listing table with the specified values.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Basketball Players, and the headers of this table are No,Player,Height,Position,Year born,Current Club.\nQuestion: What is the earliest any of these players were born?\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT MIN(`Year born`) FROM `Basketball Players`;\"}) To find the earliest any of these players were born, we need to query the `Basketball Players` table for the minimum value in the `Year born` column.
