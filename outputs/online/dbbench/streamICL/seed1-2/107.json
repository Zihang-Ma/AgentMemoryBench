This is a straightforward `UPDATE` operation using the `WHERE` clause to filter the specific row.\n\nThe correct SQL query to perform this operation is:\n\n```sql\nUPDATE `Game Records` SET Opponent = 'New York Rangers' WHERE Game = 30;\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Game Records` SET Opponent = 'New York Rangers' WHERE Game = 30;\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The opponent value for game number 30 in the 'Game Records' table has been successfully updated to 'New York Rangers'.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Hockey_Game_Results, and the headers of this table are Date,Winning Team,Score,Losing Team,Score,OT,City,State/Province,Arena,Attendance.\nQuestion: did dallas or ottawa win the december 9, 1993 game?\nAssistant: The question is asking whether either Dallas or Ottawa won the game on December 9, 1993, from the `Hockey_Game_Results` table. To answer this, we need to query the table for the game on that date and check the `Winning Team` column to see if it matches either \"Dallas\" or \"Ottawa.\"\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT `Winning Team` FROM `Hockey_Game_Results` WHERE Date = 'December 9, 1993';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Winning Team` FROM `Hockey_Game_Results` WHERE Date = 'December 9, 1993';\"})\nTool: [('Dallas',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Dallas\"]}) The output indicates that Dallas was the winning team on December 9, 1993.

To answer this, we need to query the `raiders_game_stats` table and retrieve the distinct values of \"Raiders first downs\" for the row(s) where the \"Game\" is 9, then count them.\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `Raiders first downs`) FROM raiders_game_stats WHERE Game = 9;\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `Raiders first downs`) FROM raiders_game_stats WHERE Game = 9;\"})\nTool: [(1,)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"1\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Scottish Challenge Cup Finalists, and the headers of this table are Club,Wins,Last final won,Runners-up,Last final lost,Total final appearances.\nQuestion: How manywins for dunfermline athletic that has a total final appearances less than 2?\nAssistant: The question is asking for the number of wins for Dunfermline Athletic where the total final appearances are less than 2. To answer this, we need to query the `Scottish Challenge Cup Finalists` table and filter the rows based on the `Club` and `Total final appearances` conditions.\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT Wins FROM `Scottish Challenge Cup Finalists` WHERE Club = 'Dunfermline Athletic' AND `Total final appearances` < 2;\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Wins FROM `Scottish Challenge Cup Finalists` WHERE Club = 'Dunfermline Athletic' AND `Total final appearances` < 2;\"})\nTool: [('0',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"0\"]})"
