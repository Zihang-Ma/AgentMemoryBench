Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer.

To answer this, we need to query the `Medal Table` and sum the `Total` column for these specific nations.\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT SUM(`Total`) AS TotalMedals FROM `Medal Table` WHERE `Nation` IN ('South Korea', 'North Korea', 'Sweden', 'Brazil');\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT SUM(`Total`) AS TotalMedals FROM `Medal Table` WHERE `Nation` IN ('South Korea', 'North Korea', 'Sweden', 'Brazil');\"})\nTool: [(150.0,)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"150\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Olympic Medal Table, and the headers of this table are Rank,Nation,Gold,Silver,Bronze,Total.\nQuestion: Great Britain's bronze count in the Olympic Medal Table is updated to 5 and their total count is incremented by 1.\nAssistant: The question requires updating the `Bronze` column to `5` and incrementing the `Total` column by `1` in the `Olympic Medal Table` where the `Nation` column equals `'Great Britain'`. This can be achieved using an `UPDATE` statement with arithmetic operations.\n\nThe correct SQL query to perform this operation is:\n\n```sql\nUPDATE `Olympic Medal Table` SET Bronze = 5, Total = Total + 1 WHERE Nation = 'Great Britain';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Olympic Medal Table` SET Bronze = 5, Total = Total + 1 WHERE Nation = 'Great Britain';\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Great Britain's bronze count in the Olympic Medal Table has been updated to 5 and their total count has been incremented by 1.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Olympic Medal Table, and the headers of this table are Rank,Nation,Gold,Silver,Bronze,Total.\nQuestion: Japan's Olympic Medal Table has been updated with 2 Gold, 5 Silver, 4 Bronze and a total of 11 medals.\nAssistant: The question provides information about updating Japan's medal count in the `Olympic Medal Table` with 2 Gold, 5 Silver, 4 Bronze, and a total of 11 medals. This implies that the row for Japan in the table needs to be updated with these values. \n\nTo perform this update, we need to use an `UPDATE` statement to set the `Gold`, `Silver`, `Bronze`, and `Total` columns to the specified values where the `Nation` is `'Japan'`.\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nUPDATE `Olympic Medal Table` SET Gold = 2, Silver = 5, Bronze = 4, Total = 11 WHERE Nation = 'Japan';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Olympic Medal Table` SET Gold = 2, Silver = 5, Bronze = 4, Total = 11 WHERE Nation = 'Japan';\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Japan's Olympic Medal Table has been updated with 2 Gold, 5 Silver, 4 Bronze and a total of 11 medals.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Athlete Results, and the headers of this table are Year,Competition,Venue,Position,Event,Notes.\nQuestion: Insert into table 'Athlete Results' with values '2012', 'Olympic Games', 'London, UK', 'Pole vault', '12th', '5.50 m'.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `Athlete Results` (Year, Competition, Venue, Position, Event, Notes) VALUES ('2012', 'Olympic Games', 'London, UK', '12th', 'Pole vault', '5.50 m');\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Data inserted successfully.\"]})"
