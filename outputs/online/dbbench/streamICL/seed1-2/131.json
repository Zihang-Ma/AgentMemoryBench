I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

This is an `UPDATE` operation using the `WHERE` clause to filter the specific row.\n\nThe correct SQL query to perform this operation is:\n\n```sql\nUPDATE `Rugby Teams and Their Accomplishments` SET Champion = '1 ( 2020 )', Semifinalist = '1 ( 2020 )' WHERE Team = 'Harvard';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Rugby Teams and Their Accomplishments` SET Champion = '1 ( 2020 )', Semifinalist = '1 ( 2020 )' WHERE Team = 'Harvard';\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The 'Champion' and 'Semifinalist' entries for the Harvard rugby team in the 'Rugby Teams and Their Accomplishments' table have been successfully updated to '1 ( 2020 )'.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is NBA Draft History, and the headers of this table are Round,Pick,Player,Position,Nationality,School/Club Team.\nQuestion: first player picked who attended school in california\nAssistant: The task is to find the first player picked in the `NBA Draft History` table who attended a school in California. To do this, we need to query the table and filter the rows where the `School/Club Team` column contains a value indicating a school in California. We will then sort the results by `Pick` in ascending order and select the first row.\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT Player FROM `NBA Draft History` WHERE `School/Club Team` LIKE '%California%' ORDER BY Pick ASC LIMIT 1;\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Player FROM `NBA Draft History` WHERE `School/Club Team` LIKE '%California%' ORDER BY Pick ASC LIMIT 1;\"})\nTool: [('Michael Miley',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Michael Miley\"]})"
