I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

The INSERT INTO query for this data would be: INSERT INTO 1952_British_Grand_Prix_0 (Pos, No, Driver, Constructor, Time, Gap) VALUES (22, 2, 'Tony Gaze', 'HWM - Alta', '2:02', '+12');\nAssistant: The task is to insert data into the '1952_British_Grand_Prix_0' table with the specified values for the headers: Pos, No, Driver, Constructor, Time, Gap. The data to be inserted is: (22, 2, 'Tony Gaze', 'HWM - Alta', '2:02', '+12'). \n\nThe correct SQL query should use backslashes to escape special characters in the column names and ensure the syntax is valid. Based on the previous attempts, the correct format for the column names is `C/W 15+` and `Oblast\\\\\\\\Age`. However, in this case, the column names are straightforward: Pos, No, Driver, Constructor, Time, Gap. Therefore, the SQL query should be:\n\nINSERT INTO `1952_British_Grand_Prix_0` (Pos, No, Driver, Constructor, Time, Gap) VALUES (22, 2, 'Tony Gaze', 'HWM - Alta', '2:02', '+12');\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `1952_British_Grand_Prix_0` (Pos, No, Driver, Constructor, Time, Gap) VALUES (22, 2, 'Tony Gaze', 'HWM - Alta', '2:02', '+12');\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Data inserted successfully.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Airport Information, and the headers of this table are City,Country,Airport,IATA,ICAO.\nQuestion: Add to 'Airport Information' the city 'Paris', country 'France', airport 'Charles de Gaulle Airport', IATA code 'CDG', and ICAO code 'LFPG'.\nAssistant: The question requires inserting a new record into the `Airport Information` table with the specified values: `City` as 'Paris', `Country` as 'France', `Airport` as 'Charles de Gaulle Airport', `IATA` as 'CDG', and `ICAO` as 'LFPG'. This can be achieved using an `INSERT INTO` statement.\n\nThe correct SQL query to perform this operation is:\n\n```sql\nINSERT INTO `Airport Information` (City, Country, Airport, IATA, ICAO) VALUES ('Paris', 'France', 'Charles de Gaulle Airport', 'CDG', 'LFPG');\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `Airport Information` (City, Country, Airport, IATA, ICAO) VALUES ('Paris', 'France', 'Charles de Gaulle Airport', 'CDG', 'LFPG');\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The new record with city 'Paris', country 'France', airport 'Charles de Gaulle Airport', IATA code 'CDG', and ICAO code 'LFPG' has been successfully added to the 'Airport Information' table.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Athlete Results, and the headers of this table are Year,Competition,Venue,Position,Event,Notes.\nQuestion: In the `Athlete Results` table, add a new row with the following values: Year is '2018', Competition is 'Lisbon Half Marathon', Venue is 'Lisbon, Portugal', Position is '1st', Event is 'Half marathon' and Notes is '1:09:12'.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `Athlete Results` (Year, Competition, Venue, Position, Event, Notes) VALUES (2018, 'Lisbon Half Marathon', 'Lisbon, Portugal', '1st', 'Half marathon', '1:09:12');\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Data inserted successfully.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Population by Age Group and Region in Russia, and the headers of this table are C/W 15+,Oblast\\\\Age,15 to 17,18 to 19,20 to 24,25 to 29,30 to 34,35 to 39,40 to 44,45 to 49,50 to 54,55 to 59,60 to 64,65 to 69.\nQuestion: Insert data into the table 'Population by Age Group and Region in Russia' with values for '1,984', 'Mordvins in Mordovia', '9', '105', '481', '918', '1,347', '1,675', '1,871', '1,856', '1,926', '1,997', '2,355' and '2,726'.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `Population by Age Group and Region in Russia` (C/W 15+, Oblast\\\\Age, 15 to 17, 18 to 19, 20 to 24, 25 to 29, 30 to 34, 35 to 39, 40 to 44, 45 to 49, 50 to 54, 55 to 59, 60 to 64, 65 to 69) VALUES ('1,984', 'Mordvins in Mordovia', '9', '105', '481', '918', '1,347', '1,675', '1,871', '1,856', '1,926', '1,997', '2,355', '2,726');\"})\nTool: Error: Failed to parse tool call.
