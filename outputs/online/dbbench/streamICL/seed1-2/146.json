I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

The insertion is done via the SQL command 'INSERT INTO movies_roles (Year,Title,Role,Notes) VALUES ('1958','Vertigo','Judy Barton / Madeleine Elster','-')'.\n\n\nHere are some examples of the task you have completed:\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is 1952_British_Grand_Prix_0, and the headers of this table are Pos,No,Driver,Constructor,Time,Gap.\nQuestion: The 1952 British Grand Prix saw Tony Gaze finish 22nd in his HWM - Alta with a time of 2:02, trailing the winner by 12 seconds.

The data to be inserted is: (22, 2, 'Tony Gaze', 'HWM - Alta', '2:02', '+12'). \n\nThe correct SQL query should use backslashes to escape special characters in the column names and ensure the syntax is valid.

Therefore, the SQL query should be:\n\nINSERT INTO `1952_British_Grand_Prix_0` (Pos, No, Driver, Constructor, Time, Gap) VALUES (22, 2, 'Tony Gaze', 'HWM - Alta', '2:02', '+12');\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `1952_British_Grand_Prix_0` (Pos, No, Driver, Constructor, Time, Gap) VALUES (22, 2, 'Tony Gaze', 'HWM - Alta', '2:02', '+12');\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Data inserted successfully.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is movie_production, and the headers of this table are No.,Year,Title,Notes.\nQuestion: Set the 'Notes' column to NULL in the 'movie_production' table where the 'Title' is 'Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo'.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `movie_production` SET Notes = NULL WHERE Title = 'Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo';\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The 'Notes' column has been successfully set to NULL for the movie titled 'Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo'.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Population by Age Group and Region in Russia, and the headers of this table are C/W 15+,Oblast\\\\Age,15 to 17,18 to 19,20 to 24,25 to 29,30 to 34,35 to 39,40 to 44,45 to 49,50 to 54,55 to 59,60 to 64,65 to 69.\nQuestion: Insert data into the table 'Population by Age Group and Region in Russia' with values for '1,984', 'Mordvins in Mordovia', '9', '105', '481', '918', '1,347', '1,675', '1,871', '1,856', '1,926', '1,997', '2,355' and '2,726'.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `Population by Age Group and Region in Russia` (C/W 15+, Oblast\\\\Age, 15 to 17, 18 to 19, 20 to 24, 25 to 29, 30 to 34, 35 to 39, 40 to 44, 45 to 49, 50 to 54, 55 to 59, 60 to 64, 65 to 69) VALUES ('1,984', 'Mordvins in Mordovia', '9', '105', '481', '918', '1,347', '1,675', '1,871', '1,856', '1,926', '1,997', '2,355', '2,726');\"})\nTool: Error: Failed to parse tool call.
