I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

This is a straightforward `UPDATE` operation using the `WHERE` clause to filter the specific row.\n\nThe correct SQL query to perform this operation is:\n\n```sql\nUPDATE `Tallest Buildings in Minneapolis` SET Floors = '69' WHERE Name = 'Capella Tower';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Tallest Buildings in Minneapolis` SET Floors = '69' WHERE Name = 'Capella Tower';\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The Floors value for the building named 'Capella Tower' in the Tallest Buildings in Minneapolis table has been successfully updated to '69'.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Aerial Tramway Table, and the headers of this table are Name,Year built,Country,Town,Height,Remarks.\nQuestion: what year was the last pylon in germany built?\nAssistant: The question asks for the year the last pylon in Germany was built. To answer this, we need to query the `Aerial Tramway Table` and retrieve the `Year built` value for the row where `Country` is 'Germany', sorted in descending order to get the most recent year.\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT Year built FROM `Aerial Tramway Table` WHERE Country = 'Germany' ORDER BY `Year built` DESC LIMIT 1;\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Year built` FROM `Aerial Tramway Table` WHERE Country = 'Germany' ORDER BY `Year built` DESC LIMIT 1;\"})\nTool: [('1970',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"1970\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is airlines, and the headers of this table are Airline,ICAO,IATA,Callsign,Commenced operations,Fleet size,Headquarters.\nQuestion: When did the oldest airline start operations?\nAssistant: The question asks for the commencement year of the oldest airline in the `airlines` table. To find this, we need to query the `airlines` table and retrieve the `Commenced operations` value for the row with the earliest commencement date.\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT `Commenced operations` FROM airlines ORDER BY `Commenced operations` ASC LIMIT 1;\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Commenced operations` FROM airlines ORDER BY `Commenced operations` ASC LIMIT 1;\"})\nTool: [('1941',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"1941\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is SWAT Games, and the headers of this table are Title,Year,Platform,Developer,Publisher.\nQuestion: Name the plaform for year more than 2006 and developer of 3g studios\nAssistant: The question asks for the association that entered last, which means we need to find the association with the most recent `Joining year`. This can be achieved by sorting the `Joining year` in descending order and selecting the top result.\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT Association FROM `Football Teams` ORDER BY `Joining year` DESC LIMIT 1;\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Platform FROM `SWAT Games` WHERE Year > 2006 AND Developer = '3g studios';\"})\nTool: [('PlayStation Portable',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"PlayStation Portable\"]})"
