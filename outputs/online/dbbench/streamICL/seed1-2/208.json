I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

This can be achieved using an `UPDATE` statement with a `WHERE` clause to filter the specific row based on the `Year` and `Event` columns.\n\nThe correct SQL query to perform this operation is:\n\n```sql\nUPDATE `Lawrence_Peckham_0` SET Position = '2nd' WHERE Year = '1984' AND Event = 'high jump';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Lawrence_Peckham_0` SET Position = '2nd' WHERE Year = '1984' AND Event = 'high jump';\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The position for Lawrence Peckham in the high jump event at the 1984 Olympic Games has been successfully changed to 2nd place.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Olympic Medal Table, and the headers of this table are Rank,Nation,Gold,Silver,Bronze,Total.\nQuestion: Great Britain's bronze count in the Olympic Medal Table is updated to 5 and their total count is incremented by 1.\nAssistant: The question requires updating the `Bronze` column to `5` and incrementing the `Total` column by `1` in the `Olympic Medal Table` where the `Nation` column equals `'Great Britain'`. This can be achieved using an `UPDATE` statement with arithmetic operations.\n\nThe correct SQL query to perform this operation is:\n\n```sql\nUPDATE `Olympic Medal Table` SET Bronze = 5, Total = Total + 1 WHERE Nation = 'Great Britain';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Olympic Medal Table` SET Bronze = 5, Total = Total + 1 WHERE Nation = 'Great Britain';\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Great Britain's bronze count in the Olympic Medal Table has been updated to 5 and their total count has been incremented by 1.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Nationality_Passengers_Crew_Total_Table, and the headers of this table are Nationality,Passengers,Crew,Total.\nQuestion: Set the Total column to 40 for the Nationality_Passengers_Crew_Total_Table where the Nationality column equals Spain.\nAssistant: The question requires updating the `Total` column to `40` in the `Nationality_Passengers_Crew_Total_Table` where the `Nationality` column equals `'Spain'`. This can be achieved using an `UPDATE` statement.\n\nThe correct SQL query to perform this operation is:\n\n```sql\nUPDATE `Nationality_Passengers_Crew_Total_Table` SET Total = 40 WHERE Nationality = 'Spain';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Nationality_Passengers_Crew_Total_Table` SET Total = 40 WHERE Nationality = 'Spain';\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The 'Total' column has been successfully set to 40 for the nationality 'Spain'.\"]})"
