Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

This is an `INSERT` operation.\n\nThe correct SQL query to perform this operation is:\n\n```sql\nINSERT INTO `Alumni` (Name, School, Degree, Year, Description) VALUES ('Jane Smith', 'Theo', 'PhD', '2010', 'Theology professor');\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `Alumni` (Name, School, Degree, Year, Description) VALUES ('Jane Smith', 'Theo', 'PhD', '2010', 'Theology professor');\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Data inserted successfully.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Rugby Teams and Their Accomplishments, and the headers of this table are Team,Conf/Div,Champion,Runner-up,Semifinalist,Quarterfinalist.\nQuestion: The rugby team of Harvard was updated in `Rugby Teams and Their Accomplishments` by setting 'Champion' to '1 ( 2020 )' and 'Semifinalist' to '1 ( 2020 )'.\nAssistant: The task is to update the `Champion` and `Semifinalist` columns in the `Rugby Teams and Their Accomplishments` table for the team named `'Harvard'` by setting both to `'1 ( 2020 )'`. This is an `UPDATE` operation using the `WHERE` clause to filter the specific row.\n\nThe correct SQL query to perform this operation is:\n\n```sql\nUPDATE `Rugby Teams and Their Accomplishments` SET Champion = '1 ( 2020 )', Semifinalist = '1 ( 2020 )' WHERE Team = 'Harvard';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Rugby Teams and Their Accomplishments` SET Champion = '1 ( 2020 )', Semifinalist = '1 ( 2020 )' WHERE Team = 'Harvard';\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The 'Champion' and 'Semifinalist' entries for the Harvard rugby team in the 'Rugby Teams and Their Accomplishments' table have been successfully updated to '1 ( 2020 )'.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is NBA Draft History, and the headers of this table are Round,Pick,Player,Position,Nationality,School/Club Team.\nQuestion: first player picked who attended school in california\nAssistant: The task is to find the first player picked in the `NBA Draft History` table who attended a school in California. To do this, we need to query the table and filter the rows where the `School/Club Team` column contains a value indicating a school in California. We will then sort the results by `Pick` in ascending order and select the first row.\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT Player FROM `NBA Draft History` WHERE `School/Club Team` LIKE '%California%' ORDER BY Pick ASC LIMIT 1;\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Player FROM `NBA Draft History` WHERE `School/Club Team` LIKE '%California%' ORDER BY Pick ASC LIMIT 1;\"})\nTool: [('Michael Miley',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Michael Miley\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Monarchies, and the headers of this table are Name,Title,Reign,Born,Note.\nQuestion: Change the note to 'Former monarch' for Mswati III in the Monarchies table.\nAssistant: The task is to update the `Note` column in the `Monarchies` table to `'Former monarch'` where the `Name` is `'Mswati III'`. This can be achieved using an `UPDATE` statement with a `WHERE` clause to filter the specific row.\n\nThe correct SQL query to perform this operation is:\n\n```sql\nUPDATE `Monarchies` SET Note = 'Former monarch' WHERE Name = 'Mswati III';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Monarchies` SET Note = 'Former monarch' WHERE Name = 'Mswati III';\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The note for Mswati III in the Monarchies table has been successfully changed to 'Former monarch'.\"]})"
