I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

To answer this, we need to query the `Motorcycle Race Results` table and calculate the average of the `Laps` column for rows that meet these conditions.\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT AVG(Laps) FROM `Motorcycle Race Results` WHERE Manufacturer = 'Aprilia' AND Grid = 27 AND `Time/Retired` LIKE '%Retired%' OR `Time/Retired` LIKE '%Accident%';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT AVG(Laps) FROM `Motorcycle Race Results` WHERE Manufacturer = 'Aprilia' AND Grid = 27 AND (`Time/Retired` LIKE '%Retired%' OR `Time/Retired` LIKE '%Accident%');\"})\nTool: [(12.0,)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"12.0\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam (IDFA), and the headers of this table are Year,Date (Opening),Date (Closing),Opening Film,Number of Screening,Award-Winning Film.\nQuestion: How many award-winning films have the opening film of encounters at the end of the world?\nAssistant: The question is asking for the count of award-winning films where the opening film is \"Encounters at the end of the world.\" To answer this, we need to query the `International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam (IDFA)` table and count the rows where the `Opening Film` column matches the specified title.\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) FROM `International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam (IDFA)` WHERE `Opening Film` = 'Encounters at the end of the world';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam (IDFA)` WHERE `Opening Film` = 'Encounters at the end of the world';\"})\nTool: [(1,)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"1\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Wine_Houses, and the headers of this table are House,Founding Year,Location,Cuvée,Company.\nQuestion: Change the Cuvée to 'Brut Réserve' for the Wine_Houses where the House is 'Pol Roger'\nAssistant: The question requires updating the `Cuvée` column in the `Wine_Houses` table to 'Brut Réserve' for all rows where the `House` is 'Pol Roger'. This is a straightforward `UPDATE` operation using the `WHERE` clause to filter the specific row(s).\n\nThe correct SQL query to perform this operation is:\n\n```sql\nUPDATE `Wine_Houses` SET Cuvée = 'Brut Réserve' WHERE House = 'Pol Roger';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Wine_Houses` SET Cuvée = 'Brut Réserve' WHERE House = 'Pol Roger';\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The Cuvée for the Wine_Houses where the House is 'Pol Roger' has been successfully changed to 'Brut Réserve'.\"]})"
