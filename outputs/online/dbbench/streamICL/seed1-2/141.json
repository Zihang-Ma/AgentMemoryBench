I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

This can be achieved using an `UPDATE` statement with a `WHERE` clause to filter the rows based on the `Year` condition.\n\nThe correct SQL query to perform this operation is:\n\n```sql\nUPDATE `filmography` SET Notes = '-' WHERE Year < 2010;\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `filmography` SET Notes = '-' WHERE Year < 2010;\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The 'Notes' column has been successfully set to '-' for all old films before 2010 in the filmography table.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Actor Credits, and the headers of this table are Title,Year,Role,Notes.\nQuestion: For the 'Actor Credits' table, insert a record with values for Title, Year, Role, and Notes, where Title is '¿Qué le pasa a mi familia?', Year is '2021', Role is 'Juan Pablo Del Río', and Notes is 'Main role; 120 episodes'.\nAssistant: The question requires inserting a new record into the `Actor Credits` table with the specified values: `Title` as '¿Qué le pasa a mi familia?', `Year` as '2021', `Role` as 'Juan Pablo Del Río', and `Notes` as 'Main role; 120 episodes'. This can be achieved using an `INSERT INTO` statement.\n\nThe correct SQL query to perform this operation is:\n\n```sql\nINSERT INTO `Actor Credits` (Title, Year, Role, Notes) VALUES ('¿Qué le pasa a mi familia?', '2021', 'Juan Pablo Del Río', 'Main role; 120 episodes');\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `Actor Credits` (Title, Year, Role, Notes) VALUES ('¿Qué le pasa a mi familia?', '2021', 'Juan Pablo Del Río', 'Main role; 120 episodes');\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Data inserted successfully.\"]});\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Data inserted successfully.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Theatre Performances, and the headers of this table are Year,Title,Role,Notes.\nQuestion: Add a new record to the 'Theatre Performances' table with values '2006' for Year, 'The History Boys' for Title, 'Dakin' for Role, and 'National Theatre' for Notes.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `Theatre Performances` (Year, Title, Role, Notes) VALUES ('2006', 'The History Boys', 'Dakin', 'National Theatre');\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Record added successfully to the 'Theatre Performances' table.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is SWAT Games, and the headers of this table are Title,Year,Platform,Developer,Publisher.\nQuestion: Name the plaform for year more than 2006 and developer of 3g studios\nAssistant: The question asks for the association that entered last, which means we need to find the association with the most recent `Joining year`. This can be achieved by sorting the `Joining year` in descending order and selecting the top result.\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT Association FROM `Football Teams` ORDER BY `Joining year` DESC LIMIT 1;\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Platform FROM `SWAT Games` WHERE Year > 2006 AND Developer = '3g studios';\"})\nTool: [('PlayStation Portable',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"PlayStation Portable\"]})"
