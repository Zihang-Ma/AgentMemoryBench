I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

To answer this, we need to query the `US Music Charts` table and filter the rows based on these conditions.\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT `US Cash Box` FROM `US Music Charts` WHERE `Year` < 1978 AND `US Billboard` = 35;\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `US Cash Box` FROM `US Music Charts` WHERE `Year` < 1978 AND `US Billboard` = 35;\"})\nTool: [('18',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"18\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is SWAT Games, and the headers of this table are Title,Year,Platform,Developer,Publisher.\nQuestion: Name the plaform for year more than 2006 and developer of 3g studios\nAssistant: The question asks for the association that entered last, which means we need to find the association with the most recent `Joining year`. This can be achieved by sorting the `Joining year` in descending order and selecting the top result.\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT Association FROM `Football Teams` ORDER BY `Joining year` DESC LIMIT 1;\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Platform FROM `SWAT Games` WHERE Year > 2006 AND Developer = '3g studios';\"})\nTool: [('PlayStation Portable',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"PlayStation Portable\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Jiu-Jitsu Championships Results, and the headers of this table are Result,Opponent,Method,Event,Notes.\nQuestion: What are the Notes when the Method is decision?\nAssistant: The question is asking for the `Notes` from the `Jiu-Jitsu Championships Results` table where the `Method` is `'decision'`. To answer this, we need to query the `Notes` column and filter the rows based on the `Method` being `'decision'`.\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT Notes FROM `Jiu-Jitsu Championships Results` WHERE Method = 'decision';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Notes FROM `Jiu-Jitsu Championships Results` WHERE Method = 'decision';\"})\nTool: [('Women +60kg Bronze',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Women +60kg Bronze\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Theatre Performances, and the headers of this table are Year,Title,Role,Notes.\nQuestion: Add a new record to the 'Theatre Performances' table with values '2006' for Year, 'The History Boys' for Title, 'Dakin' for Role, and 'National Theatre' for Notes.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `Theatre Performances` (Year, Title, Role, Notes) VALUES ('2006', 'The History Boys', 'Dakin', 'National Theatre');\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Record added successfully to the 'Theatre Performances' table.\"]})"
