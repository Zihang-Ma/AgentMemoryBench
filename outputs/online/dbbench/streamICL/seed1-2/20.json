This is an `INSERT` operation since the question mentions \"adding values\" to the table.\n\nThe correct SQL query to perform this operation is:\n\n```sql\nINSERT INTO `Winners By Country` (Winner, Country, Most Recent Win) VALUES ('3', 'Spain', '2005');\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `Winners By Country` (Winner, Country, Most Recent Win) VALUES ('3', 'Spain', '2005');\"})\nTool: 1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near 'Recent Win) VALUES ('3', 'Spain', '2005')' at line 1\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `Winners By Country` (Winner, Country, `Most Recent Win`) VALUES ('3', 'Spain', '2005');\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The values '3' for Winner, 'Spain' for Country, and '2005' for Most Recent Win have been successfully added to the Winners By Country table.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Nationality_Passengers_Crew_Total_Table, and the headers of this table are Nationality,Passengers,Crew,Total.\nQuestion: Set the Total column to 40 for the Nationality_Passengers_Crew_Total_Table where the Nationality column equals Spain.\nAssistant: The question requires updating the `Total` column to `40` in the `Nationality_Passengers_Crew_Total_Table` where the `Nationality` column equals `'Spain'`.
