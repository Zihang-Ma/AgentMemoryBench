I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

      "content": "Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is cellular_frequency_bands_table, and the headers of this table are System,Band,Uplink (MHz),Downlink (MHz),Channel number.\nQuestion: What band is the highest and has a System of gsm-450?\n\n\nHere are some examples of the task you have completed:\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is highest_points, and the headers of this table are Rank,Country,Claimant,Highest point,Height.\nQuestion: What is the highest amount of points for rank 95?\nAssistant: The question is asking for the highest amount of points for the rank `95` from the `highest_points` table. To answer this, we need to query the `highest_points` table and retrieve the `Highest point` value for the row where the `Rank` is `95`.\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT `Highest point` FROM `highest_points` WHERE `Rank` = 95;\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Highest point` FROM `highest_points` WHERE `Rank` = 95;\"})\nTool: [('Đeravica',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Đeravica\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is SWAT Games, and the headers of this table are Title,Year,Platform,Developer,Publisher.\nQuestion: Name the plaform for year more than 2006 and developer of 3g studios\nAssistant: The question asks for the association that entered last, which means we need to find the association with the most recent `Joining year`. This can be achieved by sorting the `Joining year` in descending order and selecting the top result.\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT Association FROM `Football Teams` ORDER BY `Joining year` DESC LIMIT 1;\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Platform FROM `SWAT Games` WHERE Year > 2006 AND Developer = '3g studios';\"})\nTool: [('PlayStation Portable',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"PlayStation Portable\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is table_14876228_1, and the headers of this table are Position,Team,Played,Wins,Draws,Losses,Scored,Conceded,Points.\nQuestion: Change the team for position 10 to Barcelona in table_14876228_1.\nAssistant: The task is to update the `table_14876228_1` table by setting the `Team` column to `'Barcelona'` where the `Position` is `10`. This is a straightforward `UPDATE` operation using the `WHERE` clause to filter the specific row(s).\n\nThe correct SQL query to perform this operation is:\n\n```sql\nUPDATE `table_14876228_1` SET Team = 'Barcelona' WHERE Position = 10;\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `table_14876228_1` SET Team = 'Barcelona' WHERE Position = 10;\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The team for position 10 in table_14876228_1 has been successfully changed to Barcelona.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Tournament Results, and the headers of this table are Tournament,2005,2006,2007,2008,2009,2010,2011,2012,2013,Win %.\nQuestion: What in 2007 has a 2008 of sf, and a 2010 of f?\nAssistant: The question is asking for the value in the `Tournament Results` table where the year is 2007, the 2008 value is 'sf', and the 2010 value is 'f'. To answer this, we need to query the `Tournament Results` table and filter the rows based on these conditions.\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT `2007` FROM `Tournament Results` WHERE `2008` = 'sf' AND `2010` = 'f';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `2007` FROM `Tournament Results` WHERE `2008` = 'sf' AND `2010` = 'f';\"})\nTool: [('F',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"F\"]})"
