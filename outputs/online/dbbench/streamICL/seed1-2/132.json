This is an `INSERT` operation since the question mentions \"adding values\" to the table.\n\nThe correct SQL query to perform this operation is:\n\n```sql\nINSERT INTO `Winners By Country` (Winner, Country, Most Recent Win) VALUES ('3', 'Spain', '2005');\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `Winners By Country` (Winner, Country, Most Recent Win) VALUES ('3', 'Spain', '2005');\"})\nTool: 1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near 'Recent Win) VALUES ('3', 'Spain', '2005')' at line 1\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `Winners By Country` (Winner, Country, `Most Recent Win`) VALUES ('3', 'Spain', '2005');\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The values '3' for Winner, 'Spain' for Country, and '2005' for Most Recent Win have been successfully added to the Winners By Country table.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is athlete_performance, and the headers of this table are Year,Competition,Venue,Position,Event,Notes.\nQuestion: Update the athlete's performance data in the 'athlete_performance' table for the '3000 m' event where the athlete finished in '2nd' position. Set the year to '1998', competition to 'Commonwealth Games', venue to 'Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia', position to '1st', and notes to '8:37.92'.\nAssistant: The task is to update the athlete's performance data in the `athlete_performance` table for the `'3000 m'` event where the athlete finished in `'2nd'` position. The new values to be set are: `Year` to `'1998'`, `Competition` to `'Commonwealth Games'`, `Venue` to `'Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia'`, `Position` to `'1st'`, and `Notes` to `'8:37.92'`. This is an `UPDATE` operation using the `WHERE` clause to filter the specific row.\n\nThe correct SQL query to perform this operation is:\n\n```sql\nUPDATE `athlete_performance` SET Year = '1998', Competition = 'Commonwealth Games', Venue = 'Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia', Position = '1st', Notes = '8:37.92' WHERE Event = '3000 m' AND Position = '2nd';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `athlete_performance` SET Year = '1998', Competition = 'Commonwealth Games', Venue = 'Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia', Position = '1st', Notes = '8:37.92' WHERE Event = '3000 m' AND Position = '2nd';\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The athlete's performance data for the '3000 m' event with '2nd' position in the 'athlete_performance' table has been successfully updated with the new values: Year '1998', Competition 'Commonwealth Games', Venue 'Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia', Position '1st', and Notes '8:37.92'.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Racing Stats, and the headers of this table are Year,Starts,Wins,Top 5,Top 10,Poles,Avg. Start,Avg. Finish,Winnings,Position,Team(s).\nQuestion: Name the avg finish for position of 70th\nAssistant: The question is asking for the average finish (`Avg. Finish`) for the position of 70th in the `Racing Stats` table. To answer this, we need to query the `Racing Stats` table and retrieve the `Avg. Finish` value where the `Position` is 70th.\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT `Avg. Finish` FROM `Racing Stats` WHERE Position = 70;\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Avg.
