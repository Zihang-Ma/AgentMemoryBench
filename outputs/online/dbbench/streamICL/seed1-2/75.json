Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer.

To do this, we need to query the table and filter the rows where the `School/Club Team` column contains a value indicating a school in California. We will then sort the results by `Pick` in ascending order and select the first row.\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT Player FROM `NBA Draft History` WHERE `School/Club Team` LIKE '%California%' ORDER BY Pick ASC LIMIT 1;\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Player FROM `NBA Draft History` WHERE `School/Club Team` LIKE '%California%' ORDER BY Pick ASC LIMIT 1;\"})\nTool: [('Michael Miley',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Michael Miley\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Basketball Tournament Stats, and the headers of this table are Tournament,Games played,Points per game,Rebounds per game,Assists per game.\nQuestion: Insert 2015 EuroBasket statistics into Basketball Tournament Stats table with 8 games played, 9.1 points per game, 7.2 rebounds per game, and 1.9 assists per game.\nAssistant: The task is to insert the 2015 EuroBasket statistics into the `Basketball Tournament Stats` table. The values to be inserted are: `8` games played, `9.1` points per game, `7.2` rebounds per game, and `1.9` assists per game. Since the `Tournament` column is not specified, we assume it is either a primary key or a column that needs to be explicitly provided. However, based on the question, it seems that the `Tournament` column is not provided, and we are to insert the row with the given values. If the `Tournament` column is not a primary key, we may need to assume a value for it or ensure it is properly handled.\n\nThe correct SQL query to perform this operation is:\n\n```sql\nINSERT INTO `Basketball Tournament Stats` (`Tournament`, `Games played`, `Points per game`, `Rebounds per game`, `Assists per game`) VALUES ('2015 EuroBasket', 8, 9.1, 7.2, 1.9);\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `Basketball Tournament Stats` (`Tournament`, `Games played`, `Points per game`, `Rebounds per game`, `Assists per game`) VALUES ('2015 EuroBasket', 8, 9.1, 7.2, 1.9);\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The 2015 EuroBasket statistics have been successfully inserted into the Basketball Tournament Stats table with 8 games played, 9.1 points per game, 7.2 rebounds per game, and 1.9 assists per game.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Basketball Players, and the headers of this table are No,Player,Height,Position,Year born,Current Club.\nQuestion: What is the earliest any of these players were born?\nAssistant: The task is to find the earliest birth year of any player in the `Basketball Players` table. To do this, we need to query the table and retrieve the minimum value from the `Year born` column.\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT MIN(`Year born`) AS earliest_birth_year FROM `Basketball Players`;\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT MIN(`Year born`) AS earliest_birth_year FROM `Basketball Players`;\"})\nTool: [('1976',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"1976\"]})"
