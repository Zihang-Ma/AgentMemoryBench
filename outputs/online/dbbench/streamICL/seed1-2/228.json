I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

The update was made to the talent_show_judges table.\n\n\nHere are some examples of the task you have completed:\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is contestants, and the headers of this table are Represents,Contestant,Age,Height (cm),Height (ft),Hometown.\nQuestion: Name the total number of represents for clary sermina delgado cid\nAssistant: The question is asking for the total number of \"Represents\" for the contestant named \"Clary Sermina Delgado Cid\" in the `contestants` table. To answer this, we need to query the `contestants` table and count the rows where the `Contestant` column matches the given name.\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(Represents) FROM contestants WHERE Contestant = 'Clary Sermina Delgado Cid';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT COUNT(Represents) FROM contestants WHERE Contestant = 'Clary Sermina Delgado Cid';\"})\nTool: [(1,)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"1\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Coaches, and the headers of this table are Name,Class,Position,Team.\nQuestion: LeBron James is an assistant coach for the Kentucky Wildcats team in the 2010 class and is being inserted into the Coaches table with respective Name, Class, Position, and Team values.\nAssistant: The task is to insert a new row into the `Coaches` table with the values `Name = 'LeBron James'`, `Class = '2010'`, `Position = 'Assistant Coach'`, and `Team = 'Kentucky Wildcats'`. This is an `INSERT` operation to add the specified data into the table.\n\nThe correct SQL query to perform this operation is:\n\n```sql\nINSERT INTO Coaches (Name, Class, Position, Team) VALUES ('LeBron James', '2010', 'Assistant Coach', 'Kentucky Wildcats');\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO Coaches (Name, Class, Position, Team) VALUES ('LeBron James', '2010', 'Assistant Coach', 'Kentucky Wildcats');\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"LeBron James has been successfully inserted into the Coaches table with the values Name = 'LeBron James', Class = '2010', Position = 'Assistant Coach', and Team = 'Kentucky Wildcats'.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Footballers, and the headers of this table are Season,Footballer,Club,Position,Nationality.\nQuestion: Change Andile Jali's position to DF in the Footballers table.\nAssistant: The task is to update the `Position` column in the `Footballers` table to `'DF'` for the row where the `Footballer` is `'Andile Jali'`. This is a straightforward `UPDATE` operation using the `WHERE` clause to filter the specific row.\n\nThe correct SQL query to perform this operation is:\n\n```sql\nUPDATE `Footballers` SET Position = 'DF' WHERE Footballer = 'Andile Jali';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Footballers` SET Position = 'DF' WHERE Footballer = 'Andile Jali';\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Andile Jali's position in the Footballers table has been successfully changed to DF.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Jiu-Jitsu Championships Results, and the headers of this table are Result,Opponent,Method,Event,Notes.\nQuestion: What are the Notes when the Method is decision?\nAssistant: The question is asking for the `Notes` from the `Jiu-Jitsu Championships Results` table where the `Method` is `'decision'`. To answer this, we need to query the `Notes` column and filter the rows based on the `Method` being `'decision'`.\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT Notes FROM `Jiu-Jitsu Championships Results` WHERE Method = 'decision';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Notes FROM `Jiu-Jitsu Championships Results` WHERE Method = 'decision';\"})\nTool: [('Women +60kg Bronze',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Women +60kg Bronze\"]})"
