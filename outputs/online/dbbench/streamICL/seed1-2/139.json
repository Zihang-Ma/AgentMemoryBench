I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

This can be achieved by sorting the `Joining year` in descending order and selecting the top result.\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT Association FROM `Football Teams` ORDER BY `Joining year` DESC LIMIT 1;\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Platform FROM `SWAT Games` WHERE Year > 2006 AND Developer = '3g studios';\"})\nTool: [('PlayStation Portable',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"PlayStation Portable\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Wine_Houses, and the headers of this table are House,Founding Year,Location,Cuvée,Company.\nQuestion: Change the Cuvée to 'Brut Réserve' for the Wine_Houses where the House is 'Pol Roger'\nAssistant: The question requires updating the `Cuvée` column in the `Wine_Houses` table to 'Brut Réserve' for all rows where the `House` is 'Pol Roger'. This is a straightforward `UPDATE` operation using the `WHERE` clause to filter the specific row(s).\n\nThe correct SQL query to perform this operation is:\n\n```sql\nUPDATE `Wine_Houses` SET Cuvée = 'Brut Réserve' WHERE House = 'Pol Roger';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Wine_Houses` SET Cuvée = 'Brut Réserve' WHERE House = 'Pol Roger';\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The Cuvée for the Wine_Houses where the House is 'Pol Roger' has been successfully changed to 'Brut Réserve'.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Airport Information, and the headers of this table are City,Country,Airport,IATA,ICAO.\nQuestion: Add to 'Airport Information' the city 'Paris', country 'France', airport 'Charles de Gaulle Airport', IATA code 'CDG', and ICAO code 'LFPG'.\nAssistant: The question requires inserting a new record into the `Airport Information` table with the specified values: `City` as 'Paris', `Country` as 'France', `Airport` as 'Charles de Gaulle Airport', `IATA` as 'CDG', and `ICAO` as 'LFPG'. This can be achieved using an `INSERT INTO` statement.\n\nThe correct SQL query to perform this operation is:\n\n```sql\nINSERT INTO `Airport Information` (City, Country, Airport, IATA, ICAO) VALUES ('Paris', 'France', 'Charles de Gaulle Airport', 'CDG', 'LFPG');\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `Airport Information` (City, Country, Airport, IATA, ICAO) VALUES ('Paris', 'France', 'Charles de Gaulle Airport', 'CDG', 'LFPG');\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The new record with city 'Paris', country 'France', airport 'Charles de Gaulle Airport', IATA code 'CDG', and ICAO code 'LFPG' has been successfully added to the 'Airport Information' table.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Motorcycle Race Results, and the headers of this table are Rider,Manufacturer,Laps,Time/Retired,Grid.\nQuestion: What is the average number of laps with an accident time/retired, aprilia manufacturer and a grid of 27?\nAssistant: The question is asking for the average number of laps where the `Manufacturer` is 'Aprilia', the `Grid` is 27, and the `Time/Retired` indicates an accident (e.g., 'Retired' or 'Accident'). To answer this, we need to query the `Motorcycle Race Results` table and calculate the average of the `Laps` column for rows that meet these conditions.\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT AVG(Laps) FROM `Motorcycle Race Results` WHERE Manufacturer = 'Aprilia' AND Grid = 27 AND `Time/Retired` LIKE '%Retired%' OR `Time/Retired` LIKE '%Accident%';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT AVG(Laps) FROM `Motorcycle Race Results` WHERE Manufacturer = 'Aprilia' AND Grid = 27 AND (`Time/Retired` LIKE '%Retired%' OR `Time/Retired` LIKE '%Accident%');\"})\nTool: [(12.0,)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"12.0\"]})"
