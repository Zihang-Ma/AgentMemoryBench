I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

This can be achieved using an `INSERT INTO` statement.\n\nThe correct SQL query to perform this operation is:\n\n```sql\nINSERT INTO `Airport Information` (City, Country, Airport, IATA, ICAO) VALUES ('Paris', 'France', 'Charles de Gaulle Airport', 'CDG', 'LFPG');\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `Airport Information` (City, Country, Airport, IATA, ICAO) VALUES ('Paris', 'France', 'Charles de Gaulle Airport', 'CDG', 'LFPG');\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The new record with city 'Paris', country 'France', airport 'Charles de Gaulle Airport', IATA code 'CDG', and ICAO code 'LFPG' has been successfully added to the 'Airport Information' table.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Airport Passengers, and the headers of this table are Rank,Airport name,City,Country or territory,IATA / ICAO Code,Passengers.\nQuestion: Change the city name to 'Haarlemmermeer' for the airport passengers with rank 23 in the table 'Airport Passengers'.\nAssistant: The question requires updating the `City` column in the `Airport Passengers` table to `'Haarlemmermeer'` where the `Rank` is `23`. This can be achieved using an `UPDATE` statement.\n\nThe correct SQL query to perform this operation is:\n\n```sql\nUPDATE `Airport Passengers` SET City = 'Haarlemmermeer' WHERE Rank = 23;\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Airport Passengers` SET City = 'Haarlemmermeer' WHERE Rank = 23;\"})\nTool: 1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near '= 23' at line 1\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Airport Passengers` SET `City` = 'Haarlemmermeer' WHERE `Rank` = 23;\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The city name for the airport passengers with rank 23 in the 'Airport Passengers' table has been successfully changed to 'Haarlemmermeer'.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Airport Information, and the headers of this table are City,Province/Region,Country,IATA,ICAO,Airport.\nQuestion: VIE is the IATA for which city?\nAssistant: The question asks for the city that corresponds to the IATA code 'VIE'. To find this, we need to query the `Airport Information` table and retrieve the `City` value where the `IATA` is 'VIE'.\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT City FROM `Airport Information` WHERE IATA = 'VIE';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT City FROM `Airport Information` WHERE IATA = 'VIE';\"})\nTool: [('Vienna',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Vienna\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Tournament Results by Year, and the headers of this table are Tournament,2006,2007,2008,2009,2011,2012.\nQuestion: Update the tournament results for the Australian Open in 2006 to 'QF', 2007 to 'SF', 2008 to 'F', 2009 to 'A', 2011 to 'A', and 2012 to 'A' in the 'Tournament Results by Year' table.\nAssistant: The task is to update the results for the \"Australian Open\" in the \"Tournament Results by Year\" table for the years 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2011, and 2012 with the specified values: 'QF' for 2006, 'SF' for 2007, 'F' for 2008, and 'A' for 2009, 2011, and 2012.\n\nTo perform this update, we need to use the `UPDATE` SQL statement and specify the new values for the corresponding years where the `Tournament` is 'Australian Open'.\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nUPDATE `Tournament Results by Year` SET `2006` = 'QF', `2007` = 'SF', `2008` = 'F', `2009` = 'A', `2011` = 'A', `2012` = 'A' WHERE `Tournament` = 'Australian Open';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Tournament Results by Year` SET `2006` = 'QF', `2007` = 'SF', `2008` = 'F', `2009` = 'A', `2011` = 'A', `2012` = 'A' WHERE `Tournament` = 'Australian Open';\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Data updated successfully.\"]})"
