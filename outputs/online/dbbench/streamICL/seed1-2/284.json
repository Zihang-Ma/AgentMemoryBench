I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

This is a straightforward `UPDATE` operation using the `WHERE` clause to filter the specific row(s).\n\nThe correct SQL query to perform this operation is:\n\n```sql\nUPDATE `Wine_Houses` SET Cuvée = 'Brut Réserve' WHERE House = 'Pol Roger';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Wine_Houses` SET Cuvée = 'Brut Réserve' WHERE House = 'Pol Roger';\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The Cuvée for the Wine_Houses where the House is 'Pol Roger' has been successfully changed to 'Brut Réserve'.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Tournament Results, and the headers of this table are Tournament,2005,2006,2007,2008,2009,2010,2011,2012,2013,Win %.\nQuestion: What in 2007 has a 2008 of sf, and a 2010 of f?\nAssistant: The question is asking for the value in the `Tournament Results` table where the year is 2007, the 2008 value is 'sf', and the 2010 value is 'f'. To answer this, we need to query the `Tournament Results` table and filter the rows based on these conditions.\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT `2007` FROM `Tournament Results` WHERE `2008` = 'sf' AND `2010` = 'f';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `2007` FROM `Tournament Results` WHERE `2008` = 'sf' AND `2010` = 'f';\"})\nTool: [('F',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"F\"]})"
