I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

To do this, we need to query the table and retrieve the minimum value from the `Year born` column.\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT MIN(`Year born`) AS earliest_birth_year FROM `Basketball Players`;\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT MIN(`Year born`) AS earliest_birth_year FROM `Basketball Players`;\"})\nTool: [('1976',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"1976\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Medal Table, and the headers of this table are Rank,Nation,Gold,Silver,Bronze,Total.\nQuestion: what is the total number of medals between south korea, north korea, sweden, and brazil?\nAssistant: The question is asking for the total number of medals for the nations South Korea, North Korea, Sweden, and Brazil from the `Medal Table`. To answer this, we need to query the `Medal Table` and sum the `Total` column for these specific nations.\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT SUM(`Total`) AS TotalMedals FROM `Medal Table` WHERE `Nation` IN ('South Korea', 'North Korea', 'Sweden', 'Brazil');\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT SUM(`Total`) AS TotalMedals FROM `Medal Table` WHERE `Nation` IN ('South Korea', 'North Korea', 'Sweden', 'Brazil');\"})\nTool: [(150.0,)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"150\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is NBA Draft History, and the headers of this table are Round,Pick,Player,Position,Nationality,School/Club Team.\nQuestion: first player picked who attended school in california\nAssistant: The task is to find the first player picked in the `NBA Draft History` table who attended a school in California. To do this, we need to query the table and filter the rows where the `School/Club Team` column contains a value indicating a school in California. We will then sort the results by `Pick` in ascending order and select the first row.\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT Player FROM `NBA Draft History` WHERE `School/Club Team` LIKE '%California%' ORDER BY Pick ASC LIMIT 1;\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Player FROM `NBA Draft History` WHERE `School/Club Team` LIKE '%California%' ORDER BY Pick ASC LIMIT 1;\"})\nTool: [('Michael Miley',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Michael Miley\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Commemorative Sculptures, and the headers of this table are Title / individual commemorated,Location,Date,Sculptor.\nQuestion: Change the date and sculptor of the 'Commemorative Sculptures' titled 'Mahatma Gandhi' to '1948' and 'Unknown' respectively.\nAssistant: The task is to update the `Date` and `Sculptor` columns in the `Commemorative Sculptures` table to `'1948'` and `'Unknown'` respectively, where the `Title / individual commemorated` is `'Mahatma Gandhi'`. This can be achieved using an `UPDATE` statement with a `WHERE` clause to filter the specific row.\n\nThe correct SQL query to perform this operation is:\n\n```sql\nUPDATE `Commemorative Sculptures` SET Date = '1948', Sculptor = 'Unknown' WHERE `Title / individual commemorated` = 'Mahatma Gandhi';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Commemorative Sculptures` SET Date = '1948', Sculptor = 'Unknown' WHERE `Title / individual commemorated` = 'Mahatma Gandhi';\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The date and sculptor for the 'Commemorative Sculptures' titled 'Mahatma Gandhi' have been successfully changed to '1948' and 'Unknown' respectively.\"]})"
