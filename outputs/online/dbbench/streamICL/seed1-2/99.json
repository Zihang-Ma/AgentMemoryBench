Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer.

Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

To answer this, we need to query the `Tournament Results` table and filter the rows based on these conditions.\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT `2007` FROM `Tournament Results` WHERE `2008` = 'sf' AND `2010` = 'f';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `2007` FROM `Tournament Results` WHERE `2008` = 'sf' AND `2010` = 'f';\"})\nTool: [('F',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"F\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is baseball_game_results, and the headers of this table are Date,Opponent,Score,Loss,Record.\nQuestion: The baseball game results were inserted into the database with the following values: Date='Jun 2', Opponent='@ Angels', Score='5–3', Loss='Montefusco (4–2)', Record='17–33' using the query: INSERT INTO baseball_game_results (Date, Opponent, Score, Loss, Record) VALUES\nAssistant: The task is to insert a new row into the `baseball_game_results` table with the specified values: Date='Jun 2', Opponent='@ Angels', Score='5–3', Loss='Montefusco (4–2)', Record='17–33'. This is a straightforward `INSERT` operation.\n\nThe correct SQL query to perform this operation is:\n\n```sql\nINSERT INTO `baseball_game_results` (Date, Opponent, Score, Loss, Record) VALUES ('Jun 2', '@ Angels', '5–3', 'Montefusco (4–2)', '17–33');\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `baseball_game_results` (Date, Opponent, Score, Loss, Record) VALUES ('Jun 2', '@ Angels', '5–3', 'Montefusco (4–2)', '17–33');\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Data inserted successfully.\"]}).\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Data inserted successfully.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Rugby Teams and Their Accomplishments, and the headers of this table are Team,Conf/Div,Champion,Runner-up,Semifinalist,Quarterfinalist.\nQuestion: The rugby team of Harvard was updated in `Rugby Teams and Their Accomplishments` by setting 'Champion' to '1 ( 2020 )' and 'Semifinalist' to '1 ( 2020 )'.\nAssistant: The task is to update the `Champion` and `Semifinalist` columns in the `Rugby Teams and Their Accomplishments` table for the team named `'Harvard'` by setting both to `'1 ( 2020 )'`. This is an `UPDATE` operation using the `WHERE` clause to filter the specific row.\n\nThe correct SQL query to perform this operation is:\n\n```sql\nUPDATE `Rugby Teams and Their Accomplishments` SET Champion = '1 ( 2020 )', Semifinalist = '1 ( 2020 )' WHERE Team = 'Harvard';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Rugby Teams and Their Accomplishments` SET Champion = '1 ( 2020 )', Semifinalist = '1 ( 2020 )' WHERE Team = 'Harvard';\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The 'Champion' and 'Semifinalist' entries for the Harvard rugby team in the 'Rugby Teams and Their Accomplishments' table have been successfully updated to '1 ( 2020 )'.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is tennis_results, and the headers of this table are Year,Tournament,Surface,Round,Winner,Score.\nQuestion: What is Round, when Winner is \"Ivanovic\", when Year is less than 2008, and when Tournament is \"Paris\"?\nAssistant: The question is asking for the `Round` value in the `tennis_results` table where the `Winner` is \"Ivanovic\", the `Year` is less than 2008, and the `Tournament` is \"Paris\". To answer this, we need to query the `tennis_results` table and filter the rows based on these conditions.\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT Round FROM tennis_results WHERE Winner = 'Ivanovic' AND Year < 2008 AND Tournament = 'Paris';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Round FROM tennis_results WHERE Winner = 'Ivanovic' AND Year < 2008 AND Tournament = 'Paris';\"})\nTool: [('QF',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"QF\"]})"
