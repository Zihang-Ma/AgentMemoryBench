I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

To answer this, we need to query the `football_matches` table and retrieve the `Crowd` value for the row(s) where the `Away team score` is 15.11 (101), then find the minimum crowd number.\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT MIN(Crowd) FROM football_matches WHERE `Away team score` = '15.11 (101)';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT MIN(Crowd) FROM football_matches WHERE `Away team score` = '15.11 (101)';\"})\nTool: [('16,000',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"16,000\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is raiders_game_stats, and the headers of this table are Game,Date,Opponent,Result,Raiders points,Opponents,Raiders first downs,Record,Attendance.\nQuestion: How many different counts of the Raiders first downs are there for the game number 9?\nAssistant: The question is asking for the number of different counts of the \"Raiders first downs\" for the game number 9 in the `raiders_game_stats` table. To answer this, we need to query the `raiders_game_stats` table and retrieve the distinct values of \"Raiders first downs\" for the row(s) where the \"Game\" is 9, then count them.\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `Raiders first downs`) FROM raiders_game_stats WHERE Game = 9;\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `Raiders first downs`) FROM raiders_game_stats WHERE Game = 9;\"})\nTool: [(1,)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"1\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Cricket Bowling Statistics, and the headers of this table are Player,Team,Matches,Overs,Runs,Wickets,Best,Econ,S/Rate,4/inns,5+/inns,Average.\nQuestion: Name the least matches for runs being 276\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Matches FROM `Cricket Bowling Statistics` WHERE Runs = 276 ORDER BY Matches ASC LIMIT 1;\"})\nTool: [('12',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"12\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Player Stats, and the headers of this table are Player,G,Tackles,Solo,Assts,Sacks,Int,Int yards,Int avg.,Int TD,Fum. rec,Fum. rec TD.\nQuestion: Name the least int yards when sacks is 11.5\nAssistant: The question is asking for the least value of \"Int yards\" in the `Player Stats` table where the \"Sacks\" value is 11.5. To answer this, we need to query the `Player Stats` table and retrieve the minimum \"Int yards\" for the row(s) where \"Sacks\" is 11.5.\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT MIN(`Int yards`) FROM `Player Stats` WHERE Sacks = 11.5;\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT MIN(`Int yards`) FROM `Player Stats` WHERE Sacks = 11.5;\"})\nTool: [('41',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"41\"]})"
