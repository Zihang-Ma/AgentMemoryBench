I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

To answer this, we need to query the `Tournament Results` table and filter the rows based on these conditions.\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT `2007` FROM `Tournament Results` WHERE `2008` = 'sf' AND `2010` = 'f';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `2007` FROM `Tournament Results` WHERE `2008` = 'sf' AND `2010` = 'f';\"})\nTool: [('F',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"F\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is standings, and the headers of this table are Position,Name,Played,Drawn,Lost,Points.\nQuestion: Update the points of ESC Kempten II (N) in the standings table to 6.\nAssistant: The task is to update the `standings` table by setting the `Points` column to `6` where the `Name` is `'ESC Kempten II (N)'`. This is a straightforward `UPDATE` operation using the `WHERE` clause to filter the specific row(s).\n\nThe correct SQL query to perform this operation is:\n\n```sql\nUPDATE `standings` SET Points = 6 WHERE Name = 'ESC Kempten II (N)';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `standings` SET Points = 6 WHERE Name = 'ESC Kempten II (N)';\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The points of ESC Kempten II (N) in the standings table have been successfully updated to 6.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Football_Player_Stats, and the headers of this table are Name,Nation,Position,League Apps,League Goals,FA Cup Apps,FA Cup Goals,Total Apps,Total Goals.\nQuestion: what are the number of league apps ted davis has?\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `League Apps` FROM `Football_Player_Stats` WHERE Name = 'Ted Davis';\"})\nTool: [('27',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"27\"]})"
