I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

This can be achieved using an `UPDATE` statement with arithmetic operations.\n\nThe correct SQL query to perform this operation is:\n\n```sql\nUPDATE `Olympic Medal Table` SET Bronze = 5, Total = Total + 1 WHERE Nation = 'Great Britain';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Olympic Medal Table` SET Bronze = 5, Total = Total + 1 WHERE Nation = 'Great Britain';\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Great Britain's bronze count in the Olympic Medal Table has been updated to 5 and their total count has been incremented by 1.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Wine_Houses, and the headers of this table are House,Founding Year,Location,Cuvée,Company.\nQuestion: Change the Cuvée to 'Brut Réserve' for the Wine_Houses where the House is 'Pol Roger'\nAssistant: The question requires updating the `Cuvée` column in the `Wine_Houses` table to 'Brut Réserve' for all rows where the `House` is 'Pol Roger'. This is a straightforward `UPDATE` operation using the `WHERE` clause to filter the specific row(s).\n\nThe correct SQL query to perform this operation is:\n\n```sql\nUPDATE `Wine_Houses` SET Cuvée = 'Brut Réserve' WHERE House = 'Pol Roger';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Wine_Houses` SET Cuvée = 'Brut Réserve' WHERE House = 'Pol Roger';\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The Cuvée for the Wine_Houses where the House is 'Pol Roger' has been successfully changed to 'Brut Réserve'.\"]})"
