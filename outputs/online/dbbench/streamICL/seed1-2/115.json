I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer.

Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

The team suffered a loss, with Cotton having a record of 3-3. The game had an attendance of 30,000, bringing the team's overall record to 30-27. The game results were inserted into the database using the following values: Date='June 2', Opponent='Red Sox', Score='3 - 2', Loss='Cotton (3-3)', Attendance='30,000', and Record='30-27'.\n\n\nHere are some examples of the task you have completed:\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is baseball_game_results, and the headers of this table are Date,Opponent,Score,Loss,Record.\nQuestion: The baseball game results were inserted into the database with the following values: Date='Jun 2', Opponent='@ Angels', Score='5–3', Loss='Montefusco (4–2)', Record='17–33' using the query: INSERT INTO baseball_game_results (Date, Opponent, Score, Loss, Record) VALUES\nAssistant: The task is to insert a new row into the `baseball_game_results` table with the specified values: Date='Jun 2', Opponent='@ Angels', Score='5–3', Loss='Montefusco (4–2)', Record='17–33'. This is a straightforward `INSERT` operation.\n\nThe correct SQL query to perform this operation is:\n\n```sql\nINSERT INTO `baseball_game_results` (Date, Opponent, Score, Loss, Record) VALUES ('Jun 2', '@ Angels', '5–3', 'Montefusco (4–2)', '17–33');\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `baseball_game_results` (Date, Opponent, Score, Loss, Record) VALUES ('Jun 2', '@ Angels', '5–3', 'Montefusco (4–2)', '17–33');\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Data inserted successfully.\"]}).\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Data inserted successfully.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Game Records, and the headers of this table are Game,November,Opponent,Score,Record,Points.\nQuestion: Change the opponent value to 'New York Rangers' for the game with number '30' in the 'Game Records' table.\nAssistant: The task is to update the `Opponent` column in the `Game Records` table to `'New York Rangers'` where the `Game` number is `'30'`. This is a straightforward `UPDATE` operation using the `WHERE` clause to filter the specific row.\n\nThe correct SQL query to perform this operation is:\n\n```sql\nUPDATE `Game Records` SET Opponent = 'New York Rangers' WHERE Game = 30;\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Game Records` SET Opponent = 'New York Rangers' WHERE Game = 30;\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The opponent value for game number 30 in the 'Game Records' table has been successfully updated to 'New York Rangers'.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Football Matches, and the headers of this table are Tie no,Home team,Score,Away team,Attendance.\nQuestion: How many attended tie number 19?\nAssistant: The question is asking for the number of attendees for tie number 19 in the `Football Matches` table. To answer this, we need to query the `Football Matches` table and retrieve the `Attendance` value for the row where `Tie no` is 19.\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT Attendance FROM `Football Matches` WHERE `Tie no` = 19;\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Attendance FROM `Football Matches` WHERE `Tie no` = 19;\"})\nTool: [('1,174',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"1,174\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Hockey_Game_Results, and the headers of this table are Date,Winning Team,Score,Losing Team,Score,OT,City,State/Province,Arena,Attendance.\nQuestion: did dallas or ottawa win the december 9, 1993 game?\nAssistant: The question is asking whether either Dallas or Ottawa won the game on December 9, 1993, from the `Hockey_Game_Results` table. To answer this, we need to query the table for the game on that date and check the `Winning Team` column to see if it matches either \"Dallas\" or \"Ottawa.\"\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT `Winning Team` FROM `Hockey_Game_Results` WHERE Date = 'December 9, 1993';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Winning Team` FROM `Hockey_Game_Results` WHERE Date = 'December 9, 1993';\"})\nTool: [('Dallas',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Dallas\"]}) The output indicates that Dallas was the winning team on December 9, 1993. Therefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n**Dallas**.\n\nI will now commit the final answer."
