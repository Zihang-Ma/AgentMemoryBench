Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer.

To answer this, we need to query the `US Music Charts` table and filter the rows based on these conditions.\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT `US Cash Box` FROM `US Music Charts` WHERE `Year` < 1978 AND `US Billboard` = 35;\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `US Cash Box` FROM `US Music Charts` WHERE `Year` < 1978 AND `US Billboard` = 35;\"})\nTool: [('18',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"18\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Racing Stats, and the headers of this table are Year,Starts,Wins,Top 5,Top 10,Poles,Avg. Start,Avg. Finish,Winnings,Position,Team(s).\nQuestion: Name the avg finish for position of 70th\nAssistant: The question is asking for the average finish (`Avg. Finish`) for the position of 70th in the `Racing Stats` table. To answer this, we need to query the `Racing Stats` table and retrieve the `Avg. Finish` value where the `Position` is 70th.\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT `Avg. Finish` FROM `Racing Stats` WHERE Position = 70;\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Avg.

To answer this, we need to query the `highest_points` table and retrieve the `Highest point` value for the row where the `Rank` is `95`.\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT `Highest point` FROM `highest_points` WHERE `Rank` = 95;\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Highest point` FROM `highest_points` WHERE `Rank` = 95;\"})\nTool: [('Đeravica',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Đeravica\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is athlete_high_jump_records, and the headers of this table are Year,Competition,Venue,Position,Event,Notes.\nQuestion: Change the Notes for the athlete_high_jump_records of the World Championships in 2009 to '2.40 m'.\nAssistant: The task is to update the `Notes` column in the `athlete_high_jump_records` table to `'2.40 m'` where the `Competition` is `'World Championships'` and the `Year` is `'2009'`. This can be achieved using an `UPDATE` statement with a `WHERE` clause to filter the specific row based on the `Year` and `Competition` columns.\n\nThe correct SQL query to perform this operation is:\n\n```sql\nUPDATE `athlete_high_jump_records` SET Notes = '2.40 m' WHERE Year = '2009' AND Competition = 'World Championships';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `athlete_high_jump_records` SET Notes = '2.40 m' WHERE Year = '2009' AND Competition = 'World Championships';\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The Notes for the athlete_high_jump_records of the World Championships in 2009 have been successfully changed to '2.40 m'.\"]})"
