I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

This can be achieved using an `UPDATE` statement with a `WHERE` clause to filter the rows based on the `Year` condition.\n\nThe correct SQL query to perform this operation is:\n\n```sql\nUPDATE `filmography` SET Notes = '-' WHERE Year < 2010;\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `filmography` SET Notes = '-' WHERE Year < 2010;\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The 'Notes' column has been successfully set to '-' for all old films before 2010 in the filmography table.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is 1952_British_Grand_Prix_0, and the headers of this table are Pos,No,Driver,Constructor,Time,Gap.\nQuestion: The 1952 British Grand Prix saw Tony Gaze finish 22nd in his HWM - Alta with a time of 2:02, trailing the winner by 12 seconds. The INSERT INTO query for this data would be: INSERT INTO 1952_British_Grand_Prix_0 (Pos, No, Driver, Constructor, Time, Gap) VALUES (22, 2, 'Tony Gaze', 'HWM - Alta', '2:02', '+12');\nAssistant: The task is to insert data into the '1952_British_Grand_Prix_0' table with the specified values for the headers: Pos, No, Driver, Constructor, Time, Gap. The data to be inserted is: (22, 2, 'Tony Gaze', 'HWM - Alta', '2:02', '+12'). \n\nThe correct SQL query should use backslashes to escape special characters in the column names and ensure the syntax is valid. Based on the previous attempts, the correct format for the column names is `C/W 15+` and `Oblast\\\\\\\\Age`. However, in this case, the column names are straightforward: Pos, No, Driver, Constructor, Time, Gap. Therefore, the SQL query should be:\n\nINSERT INTO `1952_British_Grand_Prix_0` (Pos, No, Driver, Constructor, Time, Gap) VALUES (22, 2, 'Tony Gaze', 'HWM - Alta', '2:02', '+12');\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `1952_British_Grand_Prix_0` (Pos, No, Driver, Constructor, Time, Gap) VALUES (22, 2, 'Tony Gaze', 'HWM - Alta', '2:02', '+12');\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Data inserted successfully.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Population by Age Group and Region in Russia, and the headers of this table are C/W 15+,Oblast\\\\Age,15 to 17,18 to 19,20 to 24,25 to 29,30 to 34,35 to 39,40 to 44,45 to 49,50 to 54,55 to 59,60 to 64,65 to 69.\nQuestion: Insert data into the table 'Population by Age Group and Region in Russia' with values for '1,984', 'Mordvins in Mordovia', '9', '105', '481', '918', '1,347', '1,675', '1,871', '1,856', '1,926', '1,997', '2,355' and '2,726'.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `Population by Age Group and Region in Russia` (C/W 15+, Oblast\\\\Age, 15 to 17, 18 to 19, 20 to 24, 25 to 29, 30 to 34, 35 to 39, 40 to 44, 45 to 49, 50 to 54, 55 to 59, 60 to 64, 65 to 69) VALUES ('1,984', 'Mordvins in Mordovia', '9', '105', '481', '918', '1,347', '1,675', '1,871', '1,856', '1,926', '1,997', '2,355', '2,726');\"})\nTool: Error: Failed to parse tool call.
