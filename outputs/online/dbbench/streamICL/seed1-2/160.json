      "content": "Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is NHL Rookie of the Year Award Winners, and the headers of this table are Season,Winner,Team,Position,Age.\nQuestion: The 2018-19 NHL Rookie of the Year Award was won by Elias Pettersson of the Vancouver Canucks. He played as a center and was 20 years old at the time.\n\n\nHere are some examples of the task you have completed:\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Hockey_Game_Results, and the headers of this table are Date,Winning Team,Score,Losing Team,Score,OT,City,State/Province,Arena,Attendance.\nQuestion: did dallas or ottawa win the december 9, 1993 game?\nAssistant: The question is asking whether either Dallas or Ottawa won the game on December 9, 1993, from the `Hockey_Game_Results` table. To answer this, we need to query the table for the game on that date and check the `Winning Team` column to see if it matches either \"Dallas\" or \"Ottawa.\"\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT `Winning Team` FROM `Hockey_Game_Results` WHERE Date = 'December 9, 1993';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Winning Team` FROM `Hockey_Game_Results` WHERE Date = 'December 9, 1993';\"})\nTool: [('Dallas',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Dallas\"]}) The output indicates that Dallas was the winning team on December 9, 1993. Therefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n**Dallas**.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is NBA Draft History, and the headers of this table are Round,Pick,Player,Position,Nationality,School/Club Team.\nQuestion: first player picked who attended school in california\nAssistant: The task is to find the first player picked in the `NBA Draft History` table who attended a school in California. To do this, we need to query the table and filter the rows where the `School/Club Team` column contains a value indicating a school in California. We will then sort the results by `Pick` in ascending order and select the first row.\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT Player FROM `NBA Draft History` WHERE `School/Club Team` LIKE '%California%' ORDER BY Pick ASC LIMIT 1;\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Player FROM `NBA Draft History` WHERE `School/Club Team` LIKE '%California%' ORDER BY Pick ASC LIMIT 1;\"})\nTool: [('Michael Miley',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Michael Miley\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Game Records, and the headers of this table are Game,November,Opponent,Score,Record,Points.\nQuestion: Change the opponent value to 'New York Rangers' for the game with number '30' in the 'Game Records' table.\nAssistant: The task is to update the `Opponent` column in the `Game Records` table to `'New York Rangers'` where the `Game` number is `'30'`. This is a straightforward `UPDATE` operation using the `WHERE` clause to filter the specific row.\n\nThe correct SQL query to perform this operation is:\n\n```sql\nUPDATE `Game Records` SET Opponent = 'New York Rangers' WHERE Game = 30;\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Game Records` SET Opponent = 'New York Rangers' WHERE Game = 30;\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The opponent value for game number 30 in the 'Game Records' table has been successfully updated to 'New York Rangers'.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Toronto Raptors Players, and the headers of this table are Player,No.,Nationality,Position,Years in Toronto,School/Club Team.\nQuestion: Change the 'School/Club Team' of Kyle Lowry in 'Toronto Raptors Players' to 'Cardinal Dougherty HS'.\nAssistant: The task is to update the `School/Club Team` column in the `Toronto Raptors Players` table to `'Cardinal Dougherty HS'` where the `Player` is `'Kyle Lowry'`. This is a straightforward `UPDATE` operation using the `WHERE` clause to filter the specific row.\n\nThe correct SQL query to perform this operation is:\n\n```sql\nUPDATE `Toronto Raptors Players` SET `School/Club Team` = 'Cardinal Dougherty HS' WHERE Player = 'Kyle Lowry';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Toronto Raptors Players` SET `School/Club Team` = 'Cardinal Dougherty HS' WHERE Player = 'Kyle Lowry';\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The 'School/Club Team' of Kyle Lowry in the 'Toronto Raptors Players' table has been successfully changed to 'Cardinal Dougherty HS'.\"]})"
