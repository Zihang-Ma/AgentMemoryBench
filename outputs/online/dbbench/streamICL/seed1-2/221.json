To answer this, we need to query the `Golf Champions` table and calculate the average of the `Total` column for rows where the `Player` is 'Hale Irwin' and the `Finish` is 'T52'.\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT AVG(Total) FROM `Golf Champions` WHERE Player = 'Hale Irwin' AND Finish = 'T52';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT AVG(Total) FROM `Golf Champions` WHERE Player = 'Hale Irwin' AND Finish = 'T52';\"})\nTool: [(293.0,)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"293.0\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Winners By Country, and the headers of this table are Winner,Country,Most Recent Win.\nQuestion: The `Winners By Country` table is being updated by adding the values '3' for `Winner`, 'Spain' for `Country`, and '2005' for `Most Recent Win`.\nAssistant: The task is to update the `Winners By Country` table by adding the values `'3'` for `Winner`, `'Spain'` for `Country`, and `'2005'` for `Most Recent Win`. This is an `INSERT` operation since the question mentions \"adding values\" to the table.\n\nThe correct SQL query to perform this operation is:\n\n```sql\nINSERT INTO `Winners By Country` (Winner, Country, Most Recent Win) VALUES ('3', 'Spain', '2005');\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `Winners By Country` (Winner, Country, Most Recent Win) VALUES ('3', 'Spain', '2005');\"})\nTool: 1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near 'Recent Win) VALUES ('3', 'Spain', '2005')' at line 1\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `Winners By Country` (Winner, Country, `Most Recent Win`) VALUES ('3', 'Spain', '2005');\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The values '3' for Winner, 'Spain' for Country, and '2005' for Most Recent Win have been successfully added to the Winners By Country table.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Tournament Results by Year, and the headers of this table are Tournament,2006,2007,2008,2009,2011,2012.\nQuestion: Update the tournament results for the Australian Open in 2006 to 'QF', 2007 to 'SF', 2008 to 'F', 2009 to 'A', 2011 to 'A', and 2012 to 'A' in the 'Tournament Results by Year' table.\nAssistant: The task is to update the results for the \"Australian Open\" in the \"Tournament Results by Year\" table for the years 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2011, and 2012 with the specified values: 'QF' for 2006, 'SF' for 2007, 'F' for 2008, and 'A' for 2009, 2011, and 2012.\n\nTo perform this update, we need to use the `UPDATE` SQL statement and specify the new values for the corresponding years where the `Tournament` is 'Australian Open'.\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nUPDATE `Tournament Results by Year` SET `2006` = 'QF', `2007` = 'SF', `2008` = 'F', `2009` = 'A', `2011` = 'A', `2012` = 'A' WHERE `Tournament` = 'Australian Open';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Tournament Results by Year` SET `2006` = 'QF', `2007` = 'SF', `2008` = 'F', `2009` = 'A', `2011` = 'A', `2012` = 'A' WHERE `Tournament` = 'Australian Open';\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Data updated successfully.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Rugby Teams and Their Accomplishments, and the headers of this table are Team,Conf/Div,Champion,Runner-up,Semifinalist,Quarterfinalist.\nQuestion: The rugby team of Harvard was updated in `Rugby Teams and Their Accomplishments` by setting 'Champion' to '1 ( 2020 )' and 'Semifinalist' to '1 ( 2020 )'.\nAssistant: The task is to update the `Champion` and `Semifinalist` columns in the `Rugby Teams and Their Accomplishments` table for the team named `'Harvard'` by setting both to `'1 ( 2020 )'`. This is an `UPDATE` operation using the `WHERE` clause to filter the specific row.\n\nThe correct SQL query to perform this operation is:\n\n```sql\nUPDATE `Rugby Teams and Their Accomplishments` SET Champion = '1 ( 2020 )', Semifinalist = '1 ( 2020 )' WHERE Team = 'Harvard';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Rugby Teams and Their Accomplishments` SET Champion = '1 ( 2020 )', Semifinalist = '1 ( 2020 )' WHERE Team = 'Harvard';\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The 'Champion' and 'Semifinalist' entries for the Harvard rugby team in the 'Rugby Teams and Their Accomplishments' table have been successfully updated to '1 ( 2020 )'.\"]})"
