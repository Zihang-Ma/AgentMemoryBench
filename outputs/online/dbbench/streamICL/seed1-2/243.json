      "content": "Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Golf scores table, and the headers of this table are Place,Player,Country,Score,To par,Money ( $ ).\nQuestion: The golf scores table has been updated for Paul Casey with a score of 70-70-70-70=280, resulting in a par score of E and winnings of $30,000.\n\n\nHere are some examples of the task you have completed:\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Tournament Results, and the headers of this table are Tournament,2005,2006,2007,2008,2009,2010,2011,2012,2013,Win %.\nQuestion: What in 2007 has a 2008 of sf, and a 2010 of f?\nAssistant: The question is asking for the value in the `Tournament Results` table where the year is 2007, the 2008 value is 'sf', and the 2010 value is 'f'. To answer this, we need to query the `Tournament Results` table and filter the rows based on these conditions.\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT `2007` FROM `Tournament Results` WHERE `2008` = 'sf' AND `2010` = 'f';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `2007` FROM `Tournament Results` WHERE `2008` = 'sf' AND `2010` = 'f';\"})\nTool: [('F',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"F\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is 1952_British_Grand_Prix_0, and the headers of this table are Pos,No,Driver,Constructor,Time,Gap.\nQuestion: The 1952 British Grand Prix saw Tony Gaze finish 22nd in his HWM - Alta with a time of 2:02, trailing the winner by 12 seconds. The INSERT INTO query for this data would be: INSERT INTO 1952_British_Grand_Prix_0 (Pos, No, Driver, Constructor, Time, Gap) VALUES (22, 2, 'Tony Gaze', 'HWM - Alta', '2:02', '+12');\nAssistant: The task is to insert data into the '1952_British_Grand_Prix_0' table with the specified values for the headers: Pos, No, Driver, Constructor, Time, Gap. The data to be inserted is: (22, 2, 'Tony Gaze', 'HWM - Alta', '2:02', '+12'). \n\nThe correct SQL query should use backslashes to escape special characters in the column names and ensure the syntax is valid. Based on the previous attempts, the correct format for the column names is `C/W 15+` and `Oblast\\\\\\\\Age`. However, in this case, the column names are straightforward: Pos, No, Driver, Constructor, Time, Gap. Therefore, the SQL query should be:\n\nINSERT INTO `1952_British_Grand_Prix_0` (Pos, No, Driver, Constructor, Time, Gap) VALUES (22, 2, 'Tony Gaze', 'HWM - Alta', '2:02', '+12');\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `1952_British_Grand_Prix_0` (Pos, No, Driver, Constructor, Time, Gap) VALUES (22, 2, 'Tony Gaze', 'HWM - Alta', '2:02', '+12');\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Data inserted successfully.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Grand Prix racing results, and the headers of this table are No,Driver,Entrant,Constructor,Chassis,Engine.\nQuestion: Update the Grand Prix racing results with the following information: Driver Charles Leclerc, Entrant Scuderia Ferrari Mission Winnow, Chassis SF21, and Engine Ferrari 065/6 for the record with No. 16.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Grand Prix racing results` SET Driver = 'Charles Leclerc', Entrant = 'Scuderia Ferrari Mission Winnow', Chassis = 'SF21', Engine = 'Ferrari 065/6' WHERE No = 16;\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The Grand Prix racing results table has been successfully updated for the record with No. 16.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is racing_career, and the headers of this table are Season,Series,Races,Wins,Podiums,Points,Final Placing.\nQuestion: Update the racing career table to set the series to 'Formula Two', races to '2', wins to '1', podiums to '2', points to '45', and final placing to '1st' where the season is '2017'.\nAssistant: The task is to update the `racing_career` table by setting the values for the columns `Series`, `Races`, `Wins`, `Podiums`, `Points`, and `Final Placing` to `'Formula Two'`, `'2'`, `'1'`, `'2'`, `'45'`, and `'1st'`, respectively, where the `Season` is `'2017'`.\n\nThe correct SQL query to perform this operation is:\n\n```sql\nUPDATE `racing_career` SET Series = 'Formula Two', Races = '2', Wins = '1', Podiums = '2', Points = '45', `Final Placing` = '1st' WHERE Season = '2017';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `racing_career` SET Series = 'Formula Two', Races = '2', Wins = '1', Podiums = '2', Points = '45', `Final Placing` = '1st' WHERE Season = '2017';\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The racing career table has been successfully updated for the season '2017'.\"]})"
