      "content": "Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Baseball Game Results, and the headers of this table are Date,Pitcher,Score,Opponent.\nQuestion: On August 3, 2004, Manny Ramirez pitched in a baseball game against the Boston Red Sox and the final score was 8-4. The game results were then inserted into a database table called Baseball Game Results.\n\n\nHere are some examples of the task you have completed:\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is baseball_game_results, and the headers of this table are Date,Opponent,Score,Loss,Record.\nQuestion: The baseball game results were inserted into the database with the following values: Date='Jun 2', Opponent='@ Angels', Score='5–3', Loss='Montefusco (4–2)', Record='17–33' using the query: INSERT INTO baseball_game_results (Date, Opponent, Score, Loss, Record) VALUES\nAssistant: The task is to insert a new row into the `baseball_game_results` table with the specified values: Date='Jun 2', Opponent='@ Angels', Score='5–3', Loss='Montefusco (4–2)', Record='17–33'. This is a straightforward `INSERT` operation.\n\nThe correct SQL query to perform this operation is:\n\n```sql\nINSERT INTO `baseball_game_results` (Date, Opponent, Score, Loss, Record) VALUES ('Jun 2', '@ Angels', '5–3', 'Montefusco (4–2)', '17–33');\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `baseball_game_results` (Date, Opponent, Score, Loss, Record) VALUES ('Jun 2', '@ Angels', '5–3', 'Montefusco (4–2)', '17–33');\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Data inserted successfully.\"]}).\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Data inserted successfully.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Game Statistics, and the headers of this table are Game,Date,Team,Score,High points,High rebounds,High assists,Location Attendance,Series.\nQuestion: Update the game statistics for game 9 by setting the high points to 'Dan Majerle (28)' and the high rebounds to 'Charles Barkley (15)'.\nAssistant: The task is to update the `High points` and `High rebounds` columns in the `Game Statistics` table for the game with the identifier `9`. This is a straightforward `UPDATE` operation using the `WHERE` clause to filter the specific row.\n\nThe correct SQL query to perform this operation is:\n\n```sql\nUPDATE `Game Statistics` SET `High points` = 'Dan Majerle (28)', `High rebounds` = 'Charles Barkley (15)' WHERE Game = 9;\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Game Statistics` SET `High points` = 'Dan Majerle (28)', `High rebounds` = 'Charles Barkley (15)' WHERE Game = 9;\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The game statistics for game 9 have been successfully updated with 'Dan Majerle (28)' as the high points and 'Charles Barkley (15)' as the high rebounds.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Hockey_Game_Results, and the headers of this table are Date,Winning Team,Score,Losing Team,Score,OT,City,State/Province,Arena,Attendance.\nQuestion: did dallas or ottawa win the december 9, 1993 game?\nAssistant: The question is asking whether either Dallas or Ottawa won the game on December 9, 1993, from the `Hockey_Game_Results` table. To answer this, we need to query the table for the game on that date and check the `Winning Team` column to see if it matches either \"Dallas\" or \"Ottawa.\"\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT `Winning Team` FROM `Hockey_Game_Results` WHERE Date = 'December 9, 1993';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Winning Team` FROM `Hockey_Game_Results` WHERE Date = 'December 9, 1993';\"})\nTool: [('Dallas',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Dallas\"]}) The output indicates that Dallas was the winning team on December 9, 1993. Therefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n**Dallas**.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Athlete Results, and the headers of this table are Year,Competition,Venue,Position,Event,Notes.\nQuestion: In the `Athlete Results` table, add a new row with the following values: Year is '2018', Competition is 'Lisbon Half Marathon', Venue is 'Lisbon, Portugal', Position is '1st', Event is 'Half marathon' and Notes is '1:09:12'.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `Athlete Results` (Year, Competition, Venue, Position, Event, Notes) VALUES (2018, 'Lisbon Half Marathon', 'Lisbon, Portugal', '1st', 'Half marathon', '1:09:12');\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Data inserted successfully.\"]})"
