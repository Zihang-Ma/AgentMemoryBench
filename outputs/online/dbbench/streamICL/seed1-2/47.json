I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

To answer this, we need to query the `Football Matches` table and retrieve the `Attendance` value for the row where `Tie no` is 19.\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT Attendance FROM `Football Matches` WHERE `Tie no` = 19;\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Attendance FROM `Football Matches` WHERE `Tie no` = 19;\"})\nTool: [('1,174',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"1,174\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is table_14876228_1, and the headers of this table are Position,Team,Played,Wins,Draws,Losses,Scored,Conceded,Points.\nQuestion: Change the team for position 10 to Barcelona in table_14876228_1.\nAssistant: The task is to update the `table_14876228_1` table by setting the `Team` column to `'Barcelona'` where the `Position` is `10`. This is a straightforward `UPDATE` operation using the `WHERE` clause to filter the specific row(s).\n\nThe correct SQL query to perform this operation is:\n\n```sql\nUPDATE `table_14876228_1` SET Team = 'Barcelona' WHERE Position = 10;\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `table_14876228_1` SET Team = 'Barcelona' WHERE Position = 10;\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The team for position 10 in table_14876228_1 has been successfully changed to Barcelona.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Jiu-Jitsu Championships Results, and the headers of this table are Result,Opponent,Method,Event,Notes.\nQuestion: What are the Notes when the Method is decision?\nAssistant: The question is asking for the `Notes` from the `Jiu-Jitsu Championships Results` table where the `Method` is `'decision'`. To answer this, we need to query the `Notes` column and filter the rows based on the `Method` being `'decision'`.\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT Notes FROM `Jiu-Jitsu Championships Results` WHERE Method = 'decision';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Notes FROM `Jiu-Jitsu Championships Results` WHERE Method = 'decision';\"})\nTool: [('Women +60kg Bronze',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Women +60kg Bronze\"]})"
