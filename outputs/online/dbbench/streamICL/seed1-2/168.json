This can be achieved using an `UPDATE` statement with a `WHERE` clause to filter the rows based on the `Year` condition.\n\nThe correct SQL query to perform this operation is:\n\n```sql\nUPDATE `filmography` SET Notes = '-' WHERE Year < 2010;\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `filmography` SET Notes = '-' WHERE Year < 2010;\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The 'Notes' column has been successfully set to '-' for all old films before 2010 in the filmography table.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is SWAT Games, and the headers of this table are Title,Year,Platform,Developer,Publisher.\nQuestion: Name the plaform for year more than 2006 and developer of 3g studios\nAssistant: The question asks for the association that entered last, which means we need to find the association with the most recent `Joining year`. This can be achieved by sorting the `Joining year` in descending order and selecting the top result.\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT Association FROM `Football Teams` ORDER BY `Joining year` DESC LIMIT 1;\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Platform FROM `SWAT Games` WHERE Year > 2006 AND Developer = '3g studios';\"})\nTool: [('PlayStation Portable',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"PlayStation Portable\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is movie_production, and the headers of this table are No.,Year,Title,Notes.\nQuestion: Set the 'Notes' column to NULL in the 'movie_production' table where the 'Title' is 'Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo'.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `movie_production` SET Notes = NULL WHERE Title = 'Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo';\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The 'Notes' column has been successfully set to NULL for the movie titled 'Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo'.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam (IDFA), and the headers of this table are Year,Date (Opening),Date (Closing),Opening Film,Number of Screening,Award-Winning Film.\nQuestion: How many award-winning films have the opening film of encounters at the end of the world?\nAssistant: The question is asking for the count of award-winning films where the opening film is \"Encounters at the end of the world.\" To answer this, we need to query the `International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam (IDFA)` table and count the rows where the `Opening Film` column matches the specified title.\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) FROM `International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam (IDFA)` WHERE `Opening Film` = 'Encounters at the end of the world';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam (IDFA)` WHERE `Opening Film` = 'Encounters at the end of the world';\"})\nTool: [(1,)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"1\"]})"
