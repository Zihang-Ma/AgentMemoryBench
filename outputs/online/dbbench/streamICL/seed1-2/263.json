I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

This is a straightforward `UPDATE` operation using the `WHERE` clause to filter the specific row(s).\n\nThe correct SQL query to perform this operation is:\n\n```sql\nUPDATE `Wine_Houses` SET Cuvée = 'Brut Réserve' WHERE House = 'Pol Roger';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Wine_Houses` SET Cuvée = 'Brut Réserve' WHERE House = 'Pol Roger';\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The Cuvée for the Wine_Houses where the House is 'Pol Roger' has been successfully changed to 'Brut Réserve'.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Hotels, and the headers of this table are Hotel,Location,Managed by Cunard,Notes.\nQuestion: Set the notes for 'The Palace Hotel' to 'Newly renovated in 2021' in the Hotels table.\nAssistant: The question requires updating the `Notes` column in the `Hotels` table to `'Newly renovated in 2021'` where the `Hotel` is `'The Palace Hotel'`. This can be achieved using an `UPDATE` statement with a `WHERE` clause to filter the row based on the `Hotel` condition.\n\nThe correct SQL query to perform this operation is:\n\n```sql\nUPDATE `Hotels` SET Notes = 'Newly renovated in 2021' WHERE Hotel = 'The Palace Hotel';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Hotels` SET Notes = 'Newly renovated in 2021' WHERE Hotel = 'The Palace Hotel';\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The 'Notes' for 'The Palace Hotel' have been successfully set to 'Newly renovated in 2021' in the Hotels table.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Aerial Tramway Table, and the headers of this table are Name,Year built,Country,Town,Height,Remarks.\nQuestion: what year was the last pylon in germany built?\nAssistant: The question asks for the year the last pylon in Germany was built. To answer this, we need to query the `Aerial Tramway Table` and retrieve the `Year built` value for the row where `Country` is 'Germany', sorted in descending order to get the most recent year.\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT Year built FROM `Aerial Tramway Table` WHERE Country = 'Germany' ORDER BY `Year built` DESC LIMIT 1;\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Year built` FROM `Aerial Tramway Table` WHERE Country = 'Germany' ORDER BY `Year built` DESC LIMIT 1;\"})\nTool: [('1970',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"1970\"]})"
