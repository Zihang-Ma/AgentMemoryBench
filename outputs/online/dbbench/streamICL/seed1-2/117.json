Detroit's record was 7-8-2.\n\n\nHere are some examples of the task you have completed:\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Hockey_Game_Results, and the headers of this table are Date,Winning Team,Score,Losing Team,Score,OT,City,State/Province,Arena,Attendance.\nQuestion: did dallas or ottawa win the december 9, 1993 game?\nAssistant: The question is asking whether either Dallas or Ottawa won the game on December 9, 1993, from the `Hockey_Game_Results` table. To answer this, we need to query the table for the game on that date and check the `Winning Team` column to see if it matches either \"Dallas\" or \"Ottawa.\"\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT `Winning Team` FROM `Hockey_Game_Results` WHERE Date = 'December 9, 1993';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Winning Team` FROM `Hockey_Game_Results` WHERE Date = 'December 9, 1993';\"})\nTool: [('Dallas',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Dallas\"]}) The output indicates that Dallas was the winning team on December 9, 1993. Therefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n**Dallas**.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Game Records, and the headers of this table are Game,November,Opponent,Score,Record,Points.\nQuestion: Change the opponent value to 'New York Rangers' for the game with number '30' in the 'Game Records' table.\nAssistant: The task is to update the `Opponent` column in the `Game Records` table to `'New York Rangers'` where the `Game` number is `'30'`. This is a straightforward `UPDATE` operation using the `WHERE` clause to filter the specific row.\n\nThe correct SQL query to perform this operation is:\n\n```sql\nUPDATE `Game Records` SET Opponent = 'New York Rangers' WHERE Game = 30;\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Game Records` SET Opponent = 'New York Rangers' WHERE Game = 30;\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The opponent value for game number 30 in the 'Game Records' table has been successfully updated to 'New York Rangers'.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is game_results, and the headers of this table are Game,Date,Team,Score,High points,High rebounds,High assists,Location Attendance,Record.\nQuestion: What was the score against Portland in game numbers under 20?\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Score FROM game_results WHERE Team = 'Portland' AND Game < 20;\"})\nTool: [('L 97–98 (OT)',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"L 97–98 (OT)\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is raiders_game_stats, and the headers of this table are Game,Date,Opponent,Result,Raiders points,Opponents,Raiders first downs,Record,Attendance.\nQuestion: How many different counts of the Raiders first downs are there for the game number 9?\nAssistant: The question is asking for the number of different counts of the \"Raiders first downs\" for the game number 9 in the `raiders_game_stats` table. To answer this, we need to query the `raiders_game_stats` table and retrieve the distinct values of \"Raiders first downs\" for the row(s) where the \"Game\" is 9, then count them.\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `Raiders first downs`) FROM raiders_game_stats WHERE Game = 9;\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `Raiders first downs`) FROM raiders_game_stats WHERE Game = 9;\"})\nTool: [(1,)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"1\"]})"
