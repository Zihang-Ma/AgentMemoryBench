To answer this, we need to query the table for the game on that date and check the `Winning Team` column to see if it matches either \"Dallas\" or \"Ottawa.\"\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT `Winning Team` FROM `Hockey_Game_Results` WHERE Date = 'December 9, 1993';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Winning Team` FROM `Hockey_Game_Results` WHERE Date = 'December 9, 1993';\"})\nTool: [('Dallas',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Dallas\"]}) The output indicates that Dallas was the winning team on December 9, 1993.
