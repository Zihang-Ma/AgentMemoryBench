I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

To answer this, we need to query the `Motorcycle Race Results` table and calculate the average of the `Laps` column for rows that meet these conditions.\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT AVG(Laps) FROM `Motorcycle Race Results` WHERE Manufacturer = 'Aprilia' AND Grid = 27 AND `Time/Retired` LIKE '%Retired%' OR `Time/Retired` LIKE '%Accident%';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT AVG(Laps) FROM `Motorcycle Race Results` WHERE Manufacturer = 'Aprilia' AND Grid = 27 AND (`Time/Retired` LIKE '%Retired%' OR `Time/Retired` LIKE '%Accident%');\"})\nTool: [(12.0,)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"12.0\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Grand Prix racing results, and the headers of this table are No,Driver,Entrant,Constructor,Chassis,Engine.\nQuestion: Update the Grand Prix racing results with the following information: Driver Charles Leclerc, Entrant Scuderia Ferrari Mission Winnow, Chassis SF21, and Engine Ferrari 065/6 for the record with No. 16.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Grand Prix racing results` SET Driver = 'Charles Leclerc', Entrant = 'Scuderia Ferrari Mission Winnow', Chassis = 'SF21', Engine = 'Ferrari 065/6' WHERE No = 16;\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The Grand Prix racing results table has been successfully updated for the record with No. 16.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Formula One Results, and the headers of this table are Year,Entrant,Chassis,Engine,Points.\nQuestion: Update the points to 18 in the Formula One Results table where the year is 2010 and the entrant is Red Bull Racing.\nAssistant: The task is to update the `Formula One Results` table by setting the `Points` column to `18` where the `Year` is `2010` and the `Entrant` is `Red Bull Racing`.\n\nThe correct SQL query to perform this operation is:\n\n```sql\nUPDATE `Formula One Results` SET Points = 18 WHERE Year = 2010 AND Entrant = 'Red Bull Racing';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Formula One Results` SET Points = 18 WHERE Year = 2010 AND Entrant = 'Red Bull Racing';\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The Formula One Results table has been successfully updated for the year 2010 and entrant Red Bull Racing.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Golf Champions, and the headers of this table are Player,Country,Year(s) won,Total,To par,Finish.\nQuestion: What is the average total of player hale irwin, who had a t52 finish?\nAssistant: The question is asking for the average total of player \"Hale Irwin\" who had a \"T52\" finish. To answer this, we need to query the `Golf Champions` table and calculate the average of the `Total` column for rows where the `Player` is 'Hale Irwin' and the `Finish` is 'T52'.\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT AVG(Total) FROM `Golf Champions` WHERE Player = 'Hale Irwin' AND Finish = 'T52';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT AVG(Total) FROM `Golf Champions` WHERE Player = 'Hale Irwin' AND Finish = 'T52';\"})\nTool: [(293.0,)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"293.0\"]})"
