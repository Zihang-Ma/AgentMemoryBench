To answer this, we need to query the `Episode Ratings` table and count the rows where the `US air date` column matches the specified date.\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) FROM `Episode Ratings` WHERE `US air date` = 'Saturday, July 11, 2009';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `Episode Ratings` WHERE `US air date` = 'Saturday, July 11, 2009';\"})\nTool: [(1,)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"1\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is racing_career, and the headers of this table are Season,Series,Races,Wins,Podiums,Points,Final Placing.\nQuestion: Update the racing career table to set the series to 'Formula Two', races to '2', wins to '1', podiums to '2', points to '45', and final placing to '1st' where the season is '2017'.\nAssistant: The task is to update the `racing_career` table by setting the values for the columns `Series`, `Races`, `Wins`, `Podiums`, `Points`, and `Final Placing` to `'Formula Two'`, `'2'`, `'1'`, `'2'`, `'45'`, and `'1st'`, respectively, where the `Season` is `'2017'`.\n\nThe correct SQL query to perform this operation is:\n\n```sql\nUPDATE `racing_career` SET Series = 'Formula Two', Races = '2', Wins = '1', Podiums = '2', Points = '45', `Final Placing` = '1st' WHERE Season = '2017';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `racing_career` SET Series = 'Formula Two', Races = '2', Wins = '1', Podiums = '2', Points = '45', `Final Placing` = '1st' WHERE Season = '2017';\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The racing career table has been successfully updated for the season '2017'.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Actor Credits, and the headers of this table are Title,Year,Role,Notes.\nQuestion: For the 'Actor Credits' table, insert a record with values for Title, Year, Role, and Notes, where Title is '¿Qué le pasa a mi familia?', Year is '2021', Role is 'Juan Pablo Del Río', and Notes is 'Main role; 120 episodes'.\nAssistant: The question requires inserting a new record into the `Actor Credits` table with the specified values: `Title` as '¿Qué le pasa a mi familia?', `Year` as '2021', `Role` as 'Juan Pablo Del Río', and `Notes` as 'Main role; 120 episodes'. This can be achieved using an `INSERT INTO` statement.\n\nThe correct SQL query to perform this operation is:\n\n```sql\nINSERT INTO `Actor Credits` (Title, Year, Role, Notes) VALUES ('¿Qué le pasa a mi familia?', '2021', 'Juan Pablo Del Río', 'Main role; 120 episodes');\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `Actor Credits` (Title, Year, Role, Notes) VALUES ('¿Qué le pasa a mi familia?', '2021', 'Juan Pablo Del Río', 'Main role; 120 episodes');\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Data inserted successfully.\"]});\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Data inserted successfully.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is filmography, and the headers of this table are Year,Film,Role,Language,Notes.\nQuestion: Set notes to '-' for old films before 2010 in the filmography table.\nAssistant: The question requires updating the `Notes` column in the `filmography` table to be set to '-' for all films where the `Year` is before 2010. This can be achieved using an `UPDATE` statement with a `WHERE` clause to filter the rows based on the `Year` condition.\n\nThe correct SQL query to perform this operation is:\n\n```sql\nUPDATE `filmography` SET Notes = '-' WHERE Year < 2010;\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `filmography` SET Notes = '-' WHERE Year < 2010;\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The 'Notes' column has been successfully set to '-' for all old films before 2010 in the filmography table.\"]})"
