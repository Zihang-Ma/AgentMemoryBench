I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

This is a straightforward `UPDATE` operation using the `WHERE` clause to filter the specific row.\n\nThe correct SQL query to perform this operation is:\n\n```sql\nUPDATE `Tallest Buildings in Minneapolis` SET Floors = '69' WHERE Name = 'Capella Tower';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Tallest Buildings in Minneapolis` SET Floors = '69' WHERE Name = 'Capella Tower';\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The Floors value for the building named 'Capella Tower' in the Tallest Buildings in Minneapolis table has been successfully updated to '69'.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is athlete_high_jump_records, and the headers of this table are Year,Competition,Venue,Position,Event,Notes.\nQuestion: Change the Notes for the athlete_high_jump_records of the World Championships in 2009 to '2.40 m'.\nAssistant: The task is to update the `Notes` column in the `athlete_high_jump_records` table to `'2.40 m'` where the `Competition` is `'World Championships'` and the `Year` is `'2009'`. This can be achieved using an `UPDATE` statement with a `WHERE` clause to filter the specific row based on the `Year` and `Competition` columns.\n\nThe correct SQL query to perform this operation is:\n\n```sql\nUPDATE `athlete_high_jump_records` SET Notes = '2.40 m' WHERE Year = '2009' AND Competition = 'World Championships';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `athlete_high_jump_records` SET Notes = '2.40 m' WHERE Year = '2009' AND Competition = 'World Championships';\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The Notes for the athlete_high_jump_records of the World Championships in 2009 have been successfully changed to '2.40 m'.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is highest_points, and the headers of this table are Rank,Country,Claimant,Highest point,Height.\nQuestion: What is the highest amount of points for rank 95?\nAssistant: The question is asking for the highest amount of points for the rank `95` from the `highest_points` table. To answer this, we need to query the `highest_points` table and retrieve the `Highest point` value for the row where the `Rank` is `95`.\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT `Highest point` FROM `highest_points` WHERE `Rank` = 95;\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Highest point` FROM `highest_points` WHERE `Rank` = 95;\"})\nTool: [('Đeravica',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Đeravica\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Great Lakes Metropolitan Areas Population and Lakes, and the headers of this table are Rank,Map Reference Number,Census Statistical Area,2007 Population,Lake(s).\nQuestion: Update the record in the table 'Great Lakes Metropolitan Areas Population and Lakes' to set 'Lake(s)' to 'Lake Huron' where the value in column 'Rank' is equal to '29'.\nAssistant: The task is to update the `Lake(s)` column in the `Great Lakes Metropolitan Areas Population and Lakes` table to `'Lake Huron'` where the `Rank` is `'29'`. This is a straightforward `UPDATE` operation using the `WHERE` clause to filter the specific row.\n\nThe correct SQL query to perform this operation is:\n\n```sql\nUPDATE `Great Lakes Metropolitan Areas Population and Lakes` SET `Lake(s)` = 'Lake Huron' WHERE `Rank` = '29';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Great Lakes Metropolitan Areas Population and Lakes` SET `Lake(s)` = 'Lake Huron' WHERE `Rank` = '29';\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The record with Rank 29 in the Great Lakes Metropolitan Areas Population and Lakes table has been successfully updated to set Lake(s) to 'Lake Huron'.\"]})"
