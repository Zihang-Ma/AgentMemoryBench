I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

This can be achieved using an `UPDATE` statement with a `WHERE` clause to filter the rows based on the `Year` condition.\n\nThe correct SQL query to perform this operation is:\n\n```sql\nUPDATE `filmography` SET Notes = '-' WHERE Year < 2010;\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `filmography` SET Notes = '-' WHERE Year < 2010;\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The 'Notes' column has been successfully set to '-' for all old films before 2010 in the filmography table.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Actor Credits, and the headers of this table are Title,Year,Role,Notes.\nQuestion: For the 'Actor Credits' table, insert a record with values for Title, Year, Role, and Notes, where Title is '¿Qué le pasa a mi familia?', Year is '2021', Role is 'Juan Pablo Del Río', and Notes is 'Main role; 120 episodes'.\nAssistant: The question requires inserting a new record into the `Actor Credits` table with the specified values: `Title` as '¿Qué le pasa a mi familia?', `Year` as '2021', `Role` as 'Juan Pablo Del Río', and `Notes` as 'Main role; 120 episodes'. This can be achieved using an `INSERT INTO` statement.\n\nThe correct SQL query to perform this operation is:\n\n```sql\nINSERT INTO `Actor Credits` (Title, Year, Role, Notes) VALUES ('¿Qué le pasa a mi familia?', '2021', 'Juan Pablo Del Río', 'Main role; 120 episodes');\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `Actor Credits` (Title, Year, Role, Notes) VALUES ('¿Qué le pasa a mi familia?', '2021', 'Juan Pablo Del Río', 'Main role; 120 episodes');\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Data inserted successfully.\"]});\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Data inserted successfully.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Jiu-Jitsu Championships Results, and the headers of this table are Result,Opponent,Method,Event,Notes.\nQuestion: What are the Notes when the Method is decision?\nAssistant: The question is asking for the `Notes` from the `Jiu-Jitsu Championships Results` table where the `Method` is `'decision'`. To answer this, we need to query the `Notes` column and filter the rows based on the `Method` being `'decision'`.\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT Notes FROM `Jiu-Jitsu Championships Results` WHERE Method = 'decision';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Notes FROM `Jiu-Jitsu Championships Results` WHERE Method = 'decision';\"})\nTool: [('Women +60kg Bronze',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Women +60kg Bronze\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Athlete Results, and the headers of this table are Year,Competition,Venue,Position,Event,Notes.\nQuestion: Insert into table 'Athlete Results' with values '2012', 'Olympic Games', 'London, UK', 'Pole vault', '12th', '5.50 m'.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `Athlete Results` (Year, Competition, Venue, Position, Event, Notes) VALUES ('2012', 'Olympic Games', 'London, UK', '12th', 'Pole vault', '5.50 m');\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Data inserted successfully.\"]})"
