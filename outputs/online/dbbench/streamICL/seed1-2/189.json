I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

The values being inserted are 17, 20 July 2008, Pendulum, The Wall, Hang Tough, and Powerball.\n\n\nHere are some examples of the task you have completed:\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is baseball_game_results, and the headers of this table are Date,Opponent,Score,Loss,Record.\nQuestion: The baseball game results were inserted into the database with the following values: Date='Jun 2', Opponent='@ Angels', Score='5–3', Loss='Montefusco (4–2)', Record='17–33' using the query: INSERT INTO baseball_game_results (Date, Opponent, Score, Loss, Record) VALUES\nAssistant: The task is to insert a new row into the `baseball_game_results` table with the specified values: Date='Jun 2', Opponent='@ Angels', Score='5–3', Loss='Montefusco (4–2)', Record='17–33'. This is a straightforward `INSERT` operation.\n\nThe correct SQL query to perform this operation is:\n\n```sql\nINSERT INTO `baseball_game_results` (Date, Opponent, Score, Loss, Record) VALUES ('Jun 2', '@ Angels', '5–3', 'Montefusco (4–2)', '17–33');\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `baseball_game_results` (Date, Opponent, Score, Loss, Record) VALUES ('Jun 2', '@ Angels', '5–3', 'Montefusco (4–2)', '17–33');\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Data inserted successfully.\"]}).\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Data inserted successfully.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Athlete Results, and the headers of this table are Year,Competition,Venue,Position,Event,Notes.\nQuestion: Insert into table 'Athlete Results' with values '2012', 'Olympic Games', 'London, UK', 'Pole vault', '12th', '5.50 m'.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `Athlete Results` (Year, Competition, Venue, Position, Event, Notes) VALUES ('2012', 'Olympic Games', 'London, UK', '12th', 'Pole vault', '5.50 m');\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Data inserted successfully.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is TV_Show_Seasons, and the headers of this table are Season,Episodes,Season Premiere,Season Finale.\nQuestion: Set the number of episodes as '21' for season '8' in the TV_Show_Seasons table.\nAssistant: The question requires updating the `Episodes` column in the `TV_Show_Seasons` table to set its value to `'21'` for the row where the `Season` is `'8'`. This can be achieved using an `UPDATE` statement with a `WHERE` clause to filter the row based on the `Season` condition.\n\nThe correct SQL query to perform this operation is:\n\n```sql\nUPDATE `TV_Show_Seasons` SET Episodes = '21' WHERE Season = '8';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `TV_Show_Seasons` SET Episodes = '21' WHERE Season = '8';\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The number of episodes for season '8' in the TV_Show_Seasons table has been successfully set to '21'.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is venue_table, and the headers of this table are Name,Location,Type.\nQuestion: Insert into the table named venue table with columns named name, location and type, values 'Västerportshallen', 'Helsingborg', 'Indoor sports arena'.\nAssistant: The task is to insert a new row into the `venue_table` with the specified values:  \n- `Name` = 'Västerportshallen'  \n- `Location` = 'Helsingborg'  \n- `Type` = 'Indoor sports arena'  \n\nThis is a straightforward `INSERT` operation using the `INSERT INTO` statement to add the specified row to the table.\n\nThe correct SQL query to perform this operation is:\n\n```sql\nINSERT INTO `venue_table` (Name, Location, Type) VALUES ('Västerportshallen', 'Helsingborg', 'Indoor sports arena');\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `venue_table` (Name, Location, Type) VALUES ('Västerportshallen', 'Helsingborg', 'Indoor sports arena');\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Data inserted successfully.\"]})"
