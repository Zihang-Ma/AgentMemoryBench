I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

      "content": "Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is State Parks Table, and the headers of this table are Park Name,County or Counties,Area in acres,Year Established,Water Body ( s ).\nQuestion: To add information about Osage Hills State Park to the State Parks Table, insert values for Park Name, County or Counties, Area in acres, Year Established, and Water Body(s) as 'Osage Hills State Park', 'Osage', '1, 100', '1936', ''.\n\n\nHere are some examples of the task you have completed:\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Senators, and the headers of this table are Senator,Party,State,Religion.\nQuestion: Insert a new record into the Senators table with values for Senator as Mitt Romney, Party as Republican, State as Utah, and Religion as Mormon.\nAssistant: The task is to insert a new record into the `Senators` table with the specified values: `Senator` as `'Mitt Romney'`, `Party` as `'Republican'`, `State` as `'Utah'`, and `Religion` as `'Mormon'`. This is a straightforward `INSERT` operation.\n\nThe correct SQL query to perform this operation is:\n\n```sql\nINSERT INTO `Senators` (Senator, Party, State, Religion) VALUES ('Mitt Romney', 'Republican', 'Utah', 'Mormon');\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `Senators` (Senator, Party, State, Religion) VALUES ('Mitt Romney', 'Republican', 'Utah', 'Mormon');\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"A new record with Senator Mitt Romney, Party Republican, State Utah, and Religion Mormon has been successfully inserted into the Senators table.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Team Information, and the headers of this table are Team,Location,Stadium,Capacity.\nQuestion: Modify the capacity of the 'Princeton Tigers' team in the 'Team Information' table to '45,000'.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Team Information` SET Capacity = '45,000' WHERE Team = 'Princeton Tigers';\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The capacity of the 'Princeton Tigers' team has been successfully modified to '45,000'.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is filmography, and the headers of this table are Year,Film,Role,Language,Notes.\nQuestion: Set notes to '-' for old films before 2010 in the filmography table.\nAssistant: The question requires updating the `Notes` column in the `filmography` table to be set to '-' for all films where the `Year` is before 2010. This can be achieved using an `UPDATE` statement with a `WHERE` clause to filter the rows based on the `Year` condition.\n\nThe correct SQL query to perform this operation is:\n\n```sql\nUPDATE `filmography` SET Notes = '-' WHERE Year < 2010;\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `filmography` SET Notes = '-' WHERE Year < 2010;\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The 'Notes' column has been successfully set to '-' for all old films before 2010 in the filmography table.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is SWAT Games, and the headers of this table are Title,Year,Platform,Developer,Publisher.\nQuestion: Name the plaform for year more than 2006 and developer of 3g studios\nAssistant: The question asks for the association that entered last, which means we need to find the association with the most recent `Joining year`. This can be achieved by sorting the `Joining year` in descending order and selecting the top result.\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT Association FROM `Football Teams` ORDER BY `Joining year` DESC LIMIT 1;\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Platform FROM `SWAT Games` WHERE Year > 2006 AND Developer = '3g studios';\"})\nTool: [('PlayStation Portable',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"PlayStation Portable\"]})"
