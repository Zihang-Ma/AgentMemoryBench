I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

This is a straightforward `UPDATE` operation using the `WHERE` clause to filter the specific row(s).\n\nThe correct SQL query to perform this operation is:\n\n```sql\nUPDATE `Wine_Houses` SET Cuvée = 'Brut Réserve' WHERE House = 'Pol Roger';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Wine_Houses` SET Cuvée = 'Brut Réserve' WHERE House = 'Pol Roger';\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The Cuvée for the Wine_Houses where the House is 'Pol Roger' has been successfully changed to 'Brut Réserve'.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is table_14876228_1, and the headers of this table are Position,Team,Played,Wins,Draws,Losses,Scored,Conceded,Points.\nQuestion: Change the team for position 10 to Barcelona in table_14876228_1.\nAssistant: The task is to update the `table_14876228_1` table by setting the `Team` column to `'Barcelona'` where the `Position` is `10`. This is a straightforward `UPDATE` operation using the `WHERE` clause to filter the specific row(s).\n\nThe correct SQL query to perform this operation is:\n\n```sql\nUPDATE `table_14876228_1` SET Team = 'Barcelona' WHERE Position = 10;\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `table_14876228_1` SET Team = 'Barcelona' WHERE Position = 10;\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The team for position 10 in table_14876228_1 has been successfully changed to Barcelona.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Tournament Results by Year, and the headers of this table are Tournament,2006,2007,2008,2009,2011,2012.\nQuestion: Update the tournament results for the Australian Open in 2006 to 'QF', 2007 to 'SF', 2008 to 'F', 2009 to 'A', 2011 to 'A', and 2012 to 'A' in the 'Tournament Results by Year' table.\nAssistant: The task is to update the results for the \"Australian Open\" in the \"Tournament Results by Year\" table for the years 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2011, and 2012 with the specified values: 'QF' for 2006, 'SF' for 2007, 'F' for 2008, and 'A' for 2009, 2011, and 2012.\n\nTo perform this update, we need to use the `UPDATE` SQL statement and specify the new values for the corresponding years where the `Tournament` is 'Australian Open'.\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nUPDATE `Tournament Results by Year` SET `2006` = 'QF', `2007` = 'SF', `2008` = 'F', `2009` = 'A', `2011` = 'A', `2012` = 'A' WHERE `Tournament` = 'Australian Open';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Tournament Results by Year` SET `2006` = 'QF', `2007` = 'SF', `2008` = 'F', `2009` = 'A', `2011` = 'A', `2012` = 'A' WHERE `Tournament` = 'Australian Open';\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Data updated successfully.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is SWAT Games, and the headers of this table are Title,Year,Platform,Developer,Publisher.\nQuestion: Name the plaform for year more than 2006 and developer of 3g studios\nAssistant: The question asks for the association that entered last, which means we need to find the association with the most recent `Joining year`. This can be achieved by sorting the `Joining year` in descending order and selecting the top result.\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT Association FROM `Football Teams` ORDER BY `Joining year` DESC LIMIT 1;\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Platform FROM `SWAT Games` WHERE Year > 2006 AND Developer = '3g studios';\"})\nTool: [('PlayStation Portable',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"PlayStation Portable\"]})"
