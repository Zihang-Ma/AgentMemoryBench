      "content": "Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Car Specifications, and the headers of this table are Type,Construction period,Cylinder,Capacity,Power,Vmax.\nQuestion: Insert the car specifications of Model A from 1927 to 1931, which has an inline-4 cylinder engine with a 3.3-liter capacity. The car's power is 40 horsepower and it can reach a maximum speed of 105 kilometers per hour.\n\n\nHere are some examples of the task you have completed:\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Motorcycle Race Results, and the headers of this table are Rider,Manufacturer,Laps,Time/Retired,Grid.\nQuestion: What is the average number of laps with an accident time/retired, aprilia manufacturer and a grid of 27?\nAssistant: The question is asking for the average number of laps where the `Manufacturer` is 'Aprilia', the `Grid` is 27, and the `Time/Retired` indicates an accident (e.g., 'Retired' or 'Accident'). To answer this, we need to query the `Motorcycle Race Results` table and calculate the average of the `Laps` column for rows that meet these conditions.\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT AVG(Laps) FROM `Motorcycle Race Results` WHERE Manufacturer = 'Aprilia' AND Grid = 27 AND `Time/Retired` LIKE '%Retired%' OR `Time/Retired` LIKE '%Accident%';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT AVG(Laps) FROM `Motorcycle Race Results` WHERE Manufacturer = 'Aprilia' AND Grid = 27 AND (`Time/Retired` LIKE '%Retired%' OR `Time/Retired` LIKE '%Accident%');\"})\nTool: [(12.0,)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"12.0\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Grand Prix racing results, and the headers of this table are No,Driver,Entrant,Constructor,Chassis,Engine.\nQuestion: Update the Grand Prix racing results with the following information: Driver Charles Leclerc, Entrant Scuderia Ferrari Mission Winnow, Chassis SF21, and Engine Ferrari 065/6 for the record with No. 16.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Grand Prix racing results` SET Driver = 'Charles Leclerc', Entrant = 'Scuderia Ferrari Mission Winnow', Chassis = 'SF21', Engine = 'Ferrari 065/6' WHERE No = 16;\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The Grand Prix racing results table has been successfully updated for the record with No. 16.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is 1952_British_Grand_Prix_0, and the headers of this table are Pos,No,Driver,Constructor,Time,Gap.\nQuestion: The 1952 British Grand Prix saw Tony Gaze finish 22nd in his HWM - Alta with a time of 2:02, trailing the winner by 12 seconds. The INSERT INTO query for this data would be: INSERT INTO 1952_British_Grand_Prix_0 (Pos, No, Driver, Constructor, Time, Gap) VALUES (22, 2, 'Tony Gaze', 'HWM - Alta', '2:02', '+12');\nAssistant: The task is to insert data into the '1952_British_Grand_Prix_0' table with the specified values for the headers: Pos, No, Driver, Constructor, Time, Gap. The data to be inserted is: (22, 2, 'Tony Gaze', 'HWM - Alta', '2:02', '+12'). \n\nThe correct SQL query should use backslashes to escape special characters in the column names and ensure the syntax is valid. Based on the previous attempts, the correct format for the column names is `C/W 15+` and `Oblast\\\\\\\\Age`. However, in this case, the column names are straightforward: Pos, No, Driver, Constructor, Time, Gap. Therefore, the SQL query should be:\n\nINSERT INTO `1952_British_Grand_Prix_0` (Pos, No, Driver, Constructor, Time, Gap) VALUES (22, 2, 'Tony Gaze', 'HWM - Alta', '2:02', '+12');\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `1952_British_Grand_Prix_0` (Pos, No, Driver, Constructor, Time, Gap) VALUES (22, 2, 'Tony Gaze', 'HWM - Alta', '2:02', '+12');\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Data inserted successfully.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is car_racing_schedule, and the headers of this table are Race,Length,Class,Circuit,Date.\nQuestion: Modify the car racing schedule by updating the race of Grand Prix of Atlanta to be classified as Formula 1 and take place at the Atlanta Motor Speedway.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `car_racing_schedule` SET Class = 'Formula 1', Circuit = 'Atlanta Motor Speedway' WHERE Race = 'Grand Prix of Atlanta';\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The car racing schedule has been successfully updated for the 'Grand Prix of Atlanta' race.\"]})"
