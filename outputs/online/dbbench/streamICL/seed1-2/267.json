      "content": "Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Basketball Games, and the headers of this table are Game,Date,Opponent,Score,High points,High rebounds,High assists,Location/Attendance,Record.\nQuestion: The basketball game with ID 57 is updated in the database with a final score of 110-108. Irving scored the highest with 35 points, Durant got the most rebounds with 10, while Harden had the most assists with 15. The team's record is now 46-23.\n\n\nHere are some examples of the task you have completed:\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is game_results, and the headers of this table are Game,Date,Team,Score,High points,High rebounds,High assists,Location Attendance,Record.\nQuestion: What was the score against Portland in game numbers under 20?\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Score FROM game_results WHERE Team = 'Portland' AND Game < 20;\"})\nTool: [('L 97–98 (OT)',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"L 97–98 (OT)\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Game Statistics, and the headers of this table are Game,Date,Team,Score,High points,High rebounds,High assists,Location Attendance,Series.\nQuestion: Update the game statistics for game 9 by setting the high points to 'Dan Majerle (28)' and the high rebounds to 'Charles Barkley (15)'.\nAssistant: The task is to update the `High points` and `High rebounds` columns in the `Game Statistics` table for the game with the identifier `9`. This is a straightforward `UPDATE` operation using the `WHERE` clause to filter the specific row.\n\nThe correct SQL query to perform this operation is:\n\n```sql\nUPDATE `Game Statistics` SET `High points` = 'Dan Majerle (28)', `High rebounds` = 'Charles Barkley (15)' WHERE Game = 9;\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Game Statistics` SET `High points` = 'Dan Majerle (28)', `High rebounds` = 'Charles Barkley (15)' WHERE Game = 9;\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The game statistics for game 9 have been successfully updated with 'Dan Majerle (28)' as the high points and 'Charles Barkley (15)' as the high rebounds.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Basketball Tournament Stats, and the headers of this table are Tournament,Games played,Points per game,Rebounds per game,Assists per game.\nQuestion: Insert 2015 EuroBasket statistics into Basketball Tournament Stats table with 8 games played, 9.1 points per game, 7.2 rebounds per game, and 1.9 assists per game.\nAssistant: The task is to insert the 2015 EuroBasket statistics into the `Basketball Tournament Stats` table. The values to be inserted are: `8` games played, `9.1` points per game, `7.2` rebounds per game, and `1.9` assists per game. Since the `Tournament` column is not specified, we assume it is either a primary key or a column that needs to be explicitly provided. However, based on the question, it seems that the `Tournament` column is not provided, and we are to insert the row with the given values. If the `Tournament` column is not a primary key, we may need to assume a value for it or ensure it is properly handled.\n\nThe correct SQL query to perform this operation is:\n\n```sql\nINSERT INTO `Basketball Tournament Stats` (`Tournament`, `Games played`, `Points per game`, `Rebounds per game`, `Assists per game`) VALUES ('2015 EuroBasket', 8, 9.1, 7.2, 1.9);\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `Basketball Tournament Stats` (`Tournament`, `Games played`, `Points per game`, `Rebounds per game`, `Assists per game`) VALUES ('2015 EuroBasket', 8, 9.1, 7.2, 1.9);\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The 2015 EuroBasket statistics have been successfully inserted into the Basketball Tournament Stats table with 8 games played, 9.1 points per game, 7.2 rebounds per game, and 1.9 assists per game.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is game score, and the headers of this table are Game,Date,Opponent,Score,Location,Record.\nQuestion: Score of 108-85 is what lowest game?\nAssistant: The question is asking for the lowest game (i.e., the game with the smallest value in the \"Game\" column) where the \"Score\" is 108-85 in the `game score` table. To answer this, we need to query the `game score` table and retrieve the minimum \"Game\" value for the row(s) where the \"Score\" is 108-85.\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT MIN(Game) FROM `game score` WHERE Score = '108-85';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT MIN(Game) FROM `game score` WHERE Score = '108-85';\"})\nTool: [('80',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"80\"]})"
