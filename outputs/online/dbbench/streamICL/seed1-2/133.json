I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

To answer this, we need to query the `racers_database` table and calculate the average of the `Year` column for rows where the `Entrant` is 'Belanger Motors' and the `Engine` is 'Offenhauser L4'.\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT AVG(Year) FROM racers_database WHERE Entrant = 'Belanger Motors' AND Engine = 'Offenhauser L4';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT AVG(Year) FROM racers_database WHERE Entrant = 'Belanger Motors' AND Engine = 'Offenhauser L4';\"})\nTool: [(1956.0,)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"1956.0\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is airlines, and the headers of this table are Airline,ICAO,IATA,Callsign,Commenced operations,Fleet size,Headquarters.\nQuestion: When did the oldest airline start operations?\nAssistant: The question asks for the commencement year of the oldest airline in the `airlines` table. To find this, we need to query the `airlines` table and retrieve the `Commenced operations` value for the row with the earliest commencement date.\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT `Commenced operations` FROM airlines ORDER BY `Commenced operations` ASC LIMIT 1;\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Commenced operations` FROM airlines ORDER BY `Commenced operations` ASC LIMIT 1;\"})\nTool: [('1941',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"1941\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Game Records, and the headers of this table are Game,November,Opponent,Score,Record,Points.\nQuestion: Change the opponent value to 'New York Rangers' for the game with number '30' in the 'Game Records' table.\nAssistant: The task is to update the `Opponent` column in the `Game Records` table to `'New York Rangers'` where the `Game` number is `'30'`. This is a straightforward `UPDATE` operation using the `WHERE` clause to filter the specific row.\n\nThe correct SQL query to perform this operation is:\n\n```sql\nUPDATE `Game Records` SET Opponent = 'New York Rangers' WHERE Game = 30;\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Game Records` SET Opponent = 'New York Rangers' WHERE Game = 30;\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The opponent value for game number 30 in the 'Game Records' table has been successfully updated to 'New York Rangers'.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Rugby Teams and Their Accomplishments, and the headers of this table are Team,Conf/Div,Champion,Runner-up,Semifinalist,Quarterfinalist.\nQuestion: The rugby team of Harvard was updated in `Rugby Teams and Their Accomplishments` by setting 'Champion' to '1 ( 2020 )' and 'Semifinalist' to '1 ( 2020 )'.\nAssistant: The task is to update the `Champion` and `Semifinalist` columns in the `Rugby Teams and Their Accomplishments` table for the team named `'Harvard'` by setting both to `'1 ( 2020 )'`. This is an `UPDATE` operation using the `WHERE` clause to filter the specific row.\n\nThe correct SQL query to perform this operation is:\n\n```sql\nUPDATE `Rugby Teams and Their Accomplishments` SET Champion = '1 ( 2020 )', Semifinalist = '1 ( 2020 )' WHERE Team = 'Harvard';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Rugby Teams and Their Accomplishments` SET Champion = '1 ( 2020 )', Semifinalist = '1 ( 2020 )' WHERE Team = 'Harvard';\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The 'Champion' and 'Semifinalist' entries for the Harvard rugby team in the 'Rugby Teams and Their Accomplishments' table have been successfully updated to '1 ( 2020 )'.\"]})"
