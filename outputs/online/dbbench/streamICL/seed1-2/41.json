I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

To answer this, we need to query the `Tournament Results` table and filter the rows based on these conditions.\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT `2007` FROM `Tournament Results` WHERE `2008` = 'sf' AND `2010` = 'f';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `2007` FROM `Tournament Results` WHERE `2008` = 'sf' AND `2010` = 'f';\"})\nTool: [('F',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"F\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is SWAT Games, and the headers of this table are Title,Year,Platform,Developer,Publisher.\nQuestion: Name the plaform for year more than 2006 and developer of 3g studios\nAssistant: The question asks for the association that entered last, which means we need to find the association with the most recent `Joining year`. This can be achieved by sorting the `Joining year` in descending order and selecting the top result.\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT Association FROM `Football Teams` ORDER BY `Joining year` DESC LIMIT 1;\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Platform FROM `SWAT Games` WHERE Year > 2006 AND Developer = '3g studios';\"})\nTool: [('PlayStation Portable',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"PlayStation Portable\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Football Teams, and the headers of this table are Association,Joining year,Men's team,Women's team,League.\nQuestion: which association entered last?\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Association FROM `Football Teams` ORDER BY `Joining year` DESC LIMIT 1;\"})\nTool: [('Northern Mariana Islands',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Northern Mariana Islands\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Football Matches, and the headers of this table are Tie no,Home team,Score,Away team,Attendance.\nQuestion: How many attended tie number 19?\nAssistant: The question is asking for the number of attendees for tie number 19 in the `Football Matches` table. To answer this, we need to query the `Football Matches` table and retrieve the `Attendance` value for the row where `Tie no` is 19.\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT Attendance FROM `Football Matches` WHERE `Tie no` = 19;\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Attendance FROM `Football Matches` WHERE `Tie no` = 19;\"})\nTool: [('1,174',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"1,174\"]})"
