Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

This can be achieved using an `UPDATE` statement with a `WHERE` clause to filter the row based on the `Season` condition.\n\nThe correct SQL query to perform this operation is:\n\n```sql\nUPDATE `TV_Show_Seasons` SET Episodes = '21' WHERE Season = '8';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `TV_Show_Seasons` SET Episodes = '21' WHERE Season = '8';\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The number of episodes for season '8' in the TV_Show_Seasons table has been successfully set to '21'.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Episode Ratings, and the headers of this table are Episode #,US air date,Rating,Share,Rating/Share (18–49),Viewers (millions).\nQuestion: How many episodes aired Saturday, July 11, 2009\nAssistant: The question is asking for the count of episodes that aired on Saturday, July 11, 2009. To answer this, we need to query the `Episode Ratings` table and count the rows where the `US air date` column matches the specified date.\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) FROM `Episode Ratings` WHERE `US air date` = 'Saturday, July 11, 2009';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `Episode Ratings` WHERE `US air date` = 'Saturday, July 11, 2009';\"})\nTool: [(1,)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"1\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Tournament Results by Year, and the headers of this table are Tournament,2006,2007,2008,2009,2011,2012.\nQuestion: Update the tournament results for the Australian Open in 2006 to 'QF', 2007 to 'SF', 2008 to 'F', 2009 to 'A', 2011 to 'A', and 2012 to 'A' in the 'Tournament Results by Year' table.\nAssistant: The task is to update the results for the \"Australian Open\" in the \"Tournament Results by Year\" table for the years 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2011, and 2012 with the specified values: 'QF' for 2006, 'SF' for 2007, 'F' for 2008, and 'A' for 2009, 2011, and 2012.\n\nTo perform this update, we need to use the `UPDATE` SQL statement and specify the new values for the corresponding years where the `Tournament` is 'Australian Open'.\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nUPDATE `Tournament Results by Year` SET `2006` = 'QF', `2007` = 'SF', `2008` = 'F', `2009` = 'A', `2011` = 'A', `2012` = 'A' WHERE `Tournament` = 'Australian Open';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Tournament Results by Year` SET `2006` = 'QF', `2007` = 'SF', `2008` = 'F', `2009` = 'A', `2011` = 'A', `2012` = 'A' WHERE `Tournament` = 'Australian Open';\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Data updated successfully.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is filmography, and the headers of this table are Year,Film,Role,Language,Notes.\nQuestion: Set notes to '-' for old films before 2010 in the filmography table.\nAssistant: The question requires updating the `Notes` column in the `filmography` table to be set to '-' for all films where the `Year` is before 2010. This can be achieved using an `UPDATE` statement with a `WHERE` clause to filter the rows based on the `Year` condition.\n\nThe correct SQL query to perform this operation is:\n\n```sql\nUPDATE `filmography` SET Notes = '-' WHERE Year < 2010;\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `filmography` SET Notes = '-' WHERE Year < 2010;\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The 'Notes' column has been successfully set to '-' for all old films before 2010 in the filmography table.\"]})"
