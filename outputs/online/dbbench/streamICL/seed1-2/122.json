Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

The task is to insert this data into the `Athlete Results` table.\n\nThe correct SQL query to insert this data is:\n\n```sql\nINSERT INTO `Athlete Results` (Year, Competition, Venue, Position, Event, Notes) VALUES (2010, 'Continental Cup', 'Split, Croatia', '3rd', '110 m hurdles', '13.22');\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `Athlete Results` (Year, Competition, Venue, Position, Event, Notes) VALUES (2010, 'Continental Cup', 'Split, Croatia', '3rd', '110 m hurdles', '13.22');\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Data inserted successfully.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is racing_career, and the headers of this table are Season,Series,Races,Wins,Podiums,Points,Final Placing.\nQuestion: Update the racing career table to set the series to 'Formula Two', races to '2', wins to '1', podiums to '2', points to '45', and final placing to '1st' where the season is '2017'.\nAssistant: The task is to update the `racing_career` table by setting the values for the columns `Series`, `Races`, `Wins`, `Podiums`, `Points`, and `Final Placing` to `'Formula Two'`, `'2'`, `'1'`, `'2'`, `'45'`, and `'1st'`, respectively, where the `Season` is `'2017'`.\n\nThe correct SQL query to perform this operation is:\n\n```sql\nUPDATE `racing_career` SET Series = 'Formula Two', Races = '2', Wins = '1', Podiums = '2', Points = '45', `Final Placing` = '1st' WHERE Season = '2017';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `racing_career` SET Series = 'Formula Two', Races = '2', Wins = '1', Podiums = '2', Points = '45', `Final Placing` = '1st' WHERE Season = '2017';\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The racing career table has been successfully updated for the season '2017'.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is 1952_British_Grand_Prix_0, and the headers of this table are Pos,No,Driver,Constructor,Time,Gap.\nQuestion: The 1952 British Grand Prix saw Tony Gaze finish 22nd in his HWM - Alta with a time of 2:02, trailing the winner by 12 seconds. The INSERT INTO query for this data would be: INSERT INTO 1952_British_Grand_Prix_0 (Pos, No, Driver, Constructor, Time, Gap) VALUES (22, 2, 'Tony Gaze', 'HWM - Alta', '2:02', '+12');\nAssistant: The task is to insert data into the '1952_British_Grand_Prix_0' table with the specified values for the headers: Pos, No, Driver, Constructor, Time, Gap. The data to be inserted is: (22, 2, 'Tony Gaze', 'HWM - Alta', '2:02', '+12'). \n\nThe correct SQL query should use backslashes to escape special characters in the column names and ensure the syntax is valid. Based on the previous attempts, the correct format for the column names is `C/W 15+` and `Oblast\\\\\\\\Age`. However, in this case, the column names are straightforward: Pos, No, Driver, Constructor, Time, Gap. Therefore, the SQL query should be:\n\nINSERT INTO `1952_British_Grand_Prix_0` (Pos, No, Driver, Constructor, Time, Gap) VALUES (22, 2, 'Tony Gaze', 'HWM - Alta', '2:02', '+12');\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `1952_British_Grand_Prix_0` (Pos, No, Driver, Constructor, Time, Gap) VALUES (22, 2, 'Tony Gaze', 'HWM - Alta', '2:02', '+12');\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Data inserted successfully.\"]})"
