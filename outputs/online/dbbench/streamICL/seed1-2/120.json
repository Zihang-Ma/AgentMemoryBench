      "content": "Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Smooth Muscle Cell Activation Table, and the headers of this table are Cell type,Organ/system,Activators ligands -- > G q - GPCRs,Effects.\nQuestion: To record the activation of smooth muscle cells, the data of 'Cell type', 'Organ/system', 'Activators ligands --> Gq-GPCRs', and 'Effects' were inserted into 'Smooth Muscle Cell Activation Table' with the information of platelets in the circulatory system being activated by the ligand prostaglandin E2, which inhibits aggregation.\n\n\nHere are some examples of the task you have completed:\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Jiu-Jitsu Championships Results, and the headers of this table are Result,Opponent,Method,Event,Notes.\nQuestion: What are the Notes when the Method is decision?\nAssistant: The question is asking for the `Notes` from the `Jiu-Jitsu Championships Results` table where the `Method` is `'decision'`. To answer this, we need to query the `Notes` column and filter the rows based on the `Method` being `'decision'`.\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT Notes FROM `Jiu-Jitsu Championships Results` WHERE Method = 'decision';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Notes FROM `Jiu-Jitsu Championships Results` WHERE Method = 'decision';\"})\nTool: [('Women +60kg Bronze',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Women +60kg Bronze\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Motorcycle Race Results, and the headers of this table are Rider,Manufacturer,Laps,Time/Retired,Grid.\nQuestion: What is the average number of laps with an accident time/retired, aprilia manufacturer and a grid of 27?\nAssistant: The question is asking for the average number of laps where the `Manufacturer` is 'Aprilia', the `Grid` is 27, and the `Time/Retired` indicates an accident (e.g., 'Retired' or 'Accident'). To answer this, we need to query the `Motorcycle Race Results` table and calculate the average of the `Laps` column for rows that meet these conditions.\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT AVG(Laps) FROM `Motorcycle Race Results` WHERE Manufacturer = 'Aprilia' AND Grid = 27 AND `Time/Retired` LIKE '%Retired%' OR `Time/Retired` LIKE '%Accident%';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT AVG(Laps) FROM `Motorcycle Race Results` WHERE Manufacturer = 'Aprilia' AND Grid = 27 AND (`Time/Retired` LIKE '%Retired%' OR `Time/Retired` LIKE '%Accident%');\"})\nTool: [(12.0,)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"12.0\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Racing Stats, and the headers of this table are Year,Starts,Wins,Top 5,Top 10,Poles,Avg. Start,Avg. Finish,Winnings,Position,Team(s).\nQuestion: Name the avg finish for position of 70th\nAssistant: The question is asking for the average finish (`Avg. Finish`) for the position of 70th in the `Racing Stats` table. To answer this, we need to query the `Racing Stats` table and retrieve the `Avg. Finish` value where the `Position` is 70th.\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT `Avg. Finish` FROM `Racing Stats` WHERE Position = 70;\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Avg. Finish` FROM `Racing Stats` WHERE Position = 70;\"})\nTool: [('36.0',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"36.0\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Filmography, and the headers of this table are Year,Title,Role,Notes.\nQuestion: Set the Notes column to 'Released' and the Role column to 'Todd' for the rows where the Title column is 'Chaos Walking' in the Filmography table.\nAssistant: The question requires updating the `Notes` column to `'Released'` and the `Role` column to `'Todd'` for all rows in the `Filmography` table where the `Title` column is `'Chaos Walking'`. This can be achieved using an `UPDATE` statement with a `WHERE` clause to filter the rows based on the `Title` condition.\n\nThe correct SQL query to perform this operation is:\n\n```sql\nUPDATE `Filmography` SET Notes = 'Released', Role = 'Todd' WHERE Title = 'Chaos Walking';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Filmography` SET Notes = 'Released', Role = 'Todd' WHERE Title = 'Chaos Walking';\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The 'Notes' column has been successfully set to 'Released' and the 'Role' column has been successfully set to 'Todd' for the rows where the 'Title' column is 'Chaos Walking' in the Filmography table.\"]})"
