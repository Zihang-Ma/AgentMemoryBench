I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

This can be achieved using an `UPDATE` statement with a `WHERE` clause to filter the rows based on the `Year` condition.\n\nThe correct SQL query to perform this operation is:\n\n```sql\nUPDATE `filmography` SET Notes = '-' WHERE Year < 2010;\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `filmography` SET Notes = '-' WHERE Year < 2010;\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The 'Notes' column has been successfully set to '-' for all old films before 2010 in the filmography table.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Miss World Winners, and the headers of this table are Year,Winner,Represented,Placement at Miss World.\nQuestion: In the `Miss World Winners` table, update the `Represented` column to 'Taiwan' where the value in the `Year` column is equal to '2015'.\nAssistant: The task is to update the `Represented` column in the `Miss World Winners` table to `'Taiwan'` where the `Year` column is equal to `'2015'`. This can be achieved using an `UPDATE` statement with a `WHERE` clause to filter the row based on the `Year` condition.\n\nThe correct SQL query to perform this operation is:\n\n```sql\nUPDATE `Miss World Winners` SET Represented = 'Taiwan' WHERE Year = '2015';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Miss World Winners` SET Represented = 'Taiwan' WHERE Year = '2015';\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The 'Represented' column has been successfully updated to 'Taiwan' for the year '2015' in the Miss World Winners table.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is SWAT Games, and the headers of this table are Title,Year,Platform,Developer,Publisher.\nQuestion: Name the plaform for year more than 2006 and developer of 3g studios\nAssistant: The question asks for the association that entered last, which means we need to find the association with the most recent `Joining year`. This can be achieved by sorting the `Joining year` in descending order and selecting the top result.\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT Association FROM `Football Teams` ORDER BY `Joining year` DESC LIMIT 1;\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Platform FROM `SWAT Games` WHERE Year > 2006 AND Developer = '3g studios';\"})\nTool: [('PlayStation Portable',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"PlayStation Portable\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Commemorative Sculptures, and the headers of this table are Title / individual commemorated,Location,Date,Sculptor.\nQuestion: Change the date and sculptor of the 'Commemorative Sculptures' titled 'Mahatma Gandhi' to '1948' and 'Unknown' respectively.\nAssistant: The task is to update the `Date` and `Sculptor` columns in the `Commemorative Sculptures` table to `'1948'` and `'Unknown'` respectively, where the `Title / individual commemorated` is `'Mahatma Gandhi'`. This can be achieved using an `UPDATE` statement with a `WHERE` clause to filter the specific row.\n\nThe correct SQL query to perform this operation is:\n\n```sql\nUPDATE `Commemorative Sculptures` SET Date = '1948', Sculptor = 'Unknown' WHERE `Title / individual commemorated` = 'Mahatma Gandhi';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Commemorative Sculptures` SET Date = '1948', Sculptor = 'Unknown' WHERE `Title / individual commemorated` = 'Mahatma Gandhi';\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The date and sculptor for the 'Commemorative Sculptures' titled 'Mahatma Gandhi' have been successfully changed to '1948' and 'Unknown' respectively.\"]})"
