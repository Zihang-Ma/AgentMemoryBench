I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

To answer this, we need to query the `Medal Table` and sum the `Total` column for these specific nations.\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT SUM(`Total`) AS TotalMedals FROM `Medal Table` WHERE `Nation` IN ('South Korea', 'North Korea', 'Sweden', 'Brazil');\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT SUM(`Total`) AS TotalMedals FROM `Medal Table` WHERE `Nation` IN ('South Korea', 'North Korea', 'Sweden', 'Brazil');\"})\nTool: [(150.0,)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"150\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Tournament Results, and the headers of this table are Tournament,2005,2006,2007,2008,2009,2010,2011,2012,2013,Win %.\nQuestion: What in 2007 has a 2008 of sf, and a 2010 of f?\nAssistant: The question is asking for the value in the `Tournament Results` table where the year is 2007, the 2008 value is 'sf', and the 2010 value is 'f'. To answer this, we need to query the `Tournament Results` table and filter the rows based on these conditions.\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT `2007` FROM `Tournament Results` WHERE `2008` = 'sf' AND `2010` = 'f';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `2007` FROM `Tournament Results` WHERE `2008` = 'sf' AND `2010` = 'f';\"})\nTool: [('F',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"F\"]})"
