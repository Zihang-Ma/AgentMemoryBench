I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

      "content": "Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is public_transportation_lines, and the headers of this table are Line,Colour,Route,Length,Stations.\nQuestion: The Schottentour tram line, colored yellow, has a length of 11.2km (7mi) and passes through 20 stations. It is being added to the public transportation lines table.\n\n\nHere are some examples of the task you have completed:\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Medal Table, and the headers of this table are Rank,Nation,Gold,Silver,Bronze,Total.\nQuestion: what is the total number of medals between south korea, north korea, sweden, and brazil?\nAssistant: The question is asking for the total number of medals for the nations South Korea, North Korea, Sweden, and Brazil from the `Medal Table`. To answer this, we need to query the `Medal Table` and sum the `Total` column for these specific nations.\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT SUM(`Total`) AS TotalMedals FROM `Medal Table` WHERE `Nation` IN ('South Korea', 'North Korea', 'Sweden', 'Brazil');\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT SUM(`Total`) AS TotalMedals FROM `Medal Table` WHERE `Nation` IN ('South Korea', 'North Korea', 'Sweden', 'Brazil');\"})\nTool: [(150.0,)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"150\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Motorcycle Race Results, and the headers of this table are Rider,Manufacturer,Laps,Time/Retired,Grid.\nQuestion: What is the average number of laps with an accident time/retired, aprilia manufacturer and a grid of 27?\nAssistant: The question is asking for the average number of laps where the `Manufacturer` is 'Aprilia', the `Grid` is 27, and the `Time/Retired` indicates an accident (e.g., 'Retired' or 'Accident'). To answer this, we need to query the `Motorcycle Race Results` table and calculate the average of the `Laps` column for rows that meet these conditions.\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT AVG(Laps) FROM `Motorcycle Race Results` WHERE Manufacturer = 'Aprilia' AND Grid = 27 AND `Time/Retired` LIKE '%Retired%' OR `Time/Retired` LIKE '%Accident%';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT AVG(Laps) FROM `Motorcycle Race Results` WHERE Manufacturer = 'Aprilia' AND Grid = 27 AND (`Time/Retired` LIKE '%Retired%' OR `Time/Retired` LIKE '%Accident%');\"})\nTool: [(12.0,)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"12.0\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is standings, and the headers of this table are Position,Name,Played,Drawn,Lost,Points.\nQuestion: Update the points of ESC Kempten II (N) in the standings table to 6.\nAssistant: The task is to update the `standings` table by setting the `Points` column to `6` where the `Name` is `'ESC Kempten II (N)'`. This is a straightforward `UPDATE` operation using the `WHERE` clause to filter the specific row(s).\n\nThe correct SQL query to perform this operation is:\n\n```sql\nUPDATE `standings` SET Points = 6 WHERE Name = 'ESC Kempten II (N)';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `standings` SET Points = 6 WHERE Name = 'ESC Kempten II (N)';\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The points of ESC Kempten II (N) in the standings table have been successfully updated to 6.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is highest_points, and the headers of this table are Rank,Country,Claimant,Highest point,Height.\nQuestion: What is the highest amount of points for rank 95?\nAssistant: The question is asking for the highest amount of points for the rank `95` from the `highest_points` table. To answer this, we need to query the `highest_points` table and retrieve the `Highest point` value for the row where the `Rank` is `95`.\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT `Highest point` FROM `highest_points` WHERE `Rank` = 95;\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Highest point` FROM `highest_points` WHERE `Rank` = 95;\"})\nTool: [('Đeravica',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Đeravica\"]})"
