I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

To answer this, we need to query the `Olympic Medals` table and calculate the average of the `Gold` column for these specific nations.\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT AVG(Gold) AS AverageGoldMedals FROM `Olympic Medals` WHERE Nation IN ('China', 'Japan', 'North Korea');\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT AVG(Gold) AS AverageGoldMedals FROM `Olympic Medals` WHERE Nation IN ('China', 'Japan', 'North Korea');\"})\nTool: [(7.0,)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"7.0\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is athlete_performance, and the headers of this table are Year,Competition,Venue,Position,Event,Notes.\nQuestion: Update the athlete's performance data in the 'athlete_performance' table for the '3000 m' event where the athlete finished in '2nd' position. Set the year to '1998', competition to 'Commonwealth Games', venue to 'Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia', position to '1st', and notes to '8:37.92'.\nAssistant: The task is to update the athlete's performance data in the `athlete_performance` table for the `'3000 m'` event where the athlete finished in `'2nd'` position. The new values to be set are: `Year` to `'1998'`, `Competition` to `'Commonwealth Games'`, `Venue` to `'Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia'`, `Position` to `'1st'`, and `Notes` to `'8:37.92'`. This is an `UPDATE` operation using the `WHERE` clause to filter the specific row.\n\nThe correct SQL query to perform this operation is:\n\n```sql\nUPDATE `athlete_performance` SET Year = '1998', Competition = 'Commonwealth Games', Venue = 'Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia', Position = '1st', Notes = '8:37.92' WHERE Event = '3000 m' AND Position = '2nd';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `athlete_performance` SET Year = '1998', Competition = 'Commonwealth Games', Venue = 'Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia', Position = '1st', Notes = '8:37.92' WHERE Event = '3000 m' AND Position = '2nd';\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The athlete's performance data for the '3000 m' event with '2nd' position in the 'athlete_performance' table has been successfully updated with the new values: Year '1998', Competition 'Commonwealth Games', Venue 'Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia', Position '1st', and Notes '8:37.92'.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Olympic Medal Table, and the headers of this table are Rank,Nation,Gold,Silver,Bronze,Total.\nQuestion: how many nations won no silver medals at all?\nAssistant: The question is asking for the number of nations that won no silver medals at all in the `Olympic Medal Table`. To answer this, we need to query the `Olympic Medal Table` and count the number of rows where the `Silver` column is equal to `0`.\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) AS NationsWithNoSilver FROM `Olympic Medal Table` WHERE Silver = 0;\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT COUNT(*) AS NationsWithNoSilver FROM `Olympic Medal Table` WHERE Silver = 0;\"})\nTool: [(11,)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"11\"]})"
