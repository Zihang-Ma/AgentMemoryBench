Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer.

To answer this, we need to query the `game score` table and retrieve the minimum \"Game\" value for the row(s) where the \"Score\" is 108-85.\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT MIN(Game) FROM `game score` WHERE Score = '108-85';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT MIN(Game) FROM `game score` WHERE Score = '108-85';\"})\nTool: [('80',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"80\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Game Statistics, and the headers of this table are Game,Date,Team,Score,High points,High rebounds,High assists,Location Attendance,Series.\nQuestion: Update the game statistics for game 9 by setting the high points to 'Dan Majerle (28)' and the high rebounds to 'Charles Barkley (15)'.\nAssistant: The task is to update the `High points` and `High rebounds` columns in the `Game Statistics` table for the game with the identifier `9`. This is a straightforward `UPDATE` operation using the `WHERE` clause to filter the specific row.\n\nThe correct SQL query to perform this operation is:\n\n```sql\nUPDATE `Game Statistics` SET `High points` = 'Dan Majerle (28)', `High rebounds` = 'Charles Barkley (15)' WHERE Game = 9;\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Game Statistics` SET `High points` = 'Dan Majerle (28)', `High rebounds` = 'Charles Barkley (15)' WHERE Game = 9;\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The game statistics for game 9 have been successfully updated with 'Dan Majerle (28)' as the high points and 'Charles Barkley (15)' as the high rebounds.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is NBA Draft History, and the headers of this table are Round,Pick,Player,Position,Nationality,School/Club Team.\nQuestion: first player picked who attended school in california\nAssistant: The task is to find the first player picked in the `NBA Draft History` table who attended a school in California. To do this, we need to query the table and filter the rows where the `School/Club Team` column contains a value indicating a school in California. We will then sort the results by `Pick` in ascending order and select the first row.\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT Player FROM `NBA Draft History` WHERE `School/Club Team` LIKE '%California%' ORDER BY Pick ASC LIMIT 1;\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Player FROM `NBA Draft History` WHERE `School/Club Team` LIKE '%California%' ORDER BY Pick ASC LIMIT 1;\"})\nTool: [('Michael Miley',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Michael Miley\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is hockey_players, and the headers of this table are Pick #,Player,Nationality,Position,Team from,League from.\nQuestion: What is the total pick # for the D position from a team from Chilliwack Bruins?\nAssistant: The question is asking for the total pick # for the D position from a team from \"Chilliwack Bruins\" in the `hockey_players` table. To answer this, we need to query the table and filter the rows where the `Position` is `'D'` and the `Team from` is `'Chilliwack Bruins'`. Then, we will sum the `Pick #` values for these filtered rows.\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT SUM(`Pick #`) AS total_pick FROM `hockey_players` WHERE Position = 'D' AND `Team from` = 'Chilliwack Bruins';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT SUM(`Pick #`) AS total_pick FROM `hockey_players` WHERE Position = 'D' AND `Team from` = 'Chilliwack Bruins';\"})\nTool: [(167.0,)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"167\"]})"
