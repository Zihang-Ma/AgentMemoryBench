Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer.

This is an `INSERT` operation since the question mentions \"adding values\" to the table.\n\nThe correct SQL query to perform this operation is:\n\n```sql\nINSERT INTO `Winners By Country` (Winner, Country, Most Recent Win) VALUES ('3', 'Spain', '2005');\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `Winners By Country` (Winner, Country, Most Recent Win) VALUES ('3', 'Spain', '2005');\"})\nTool: 1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near 'Recent Win) VALUES ('3', 'Spain', '2005')' at line 1\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `Winners By Country` (Winner, Country, `Most Recent Win`) VALUES ('3', 'Spain', '2005');\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The values '3' for Winner, 'Spain' for Country, and '2005' for Most Recent Win have been successfully added to the Winners By Country table.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Miss World Winners, and the headers of this table are Year,Winner,Represented,Placement at Miss World.\nQuestion: In the `Miss World Winners` table, update the `Represented` column to 'Taiwan' where the value in the `Year` column is equal to '2015'.\nAssistant: The task is to update the `Represented` column in the `Miss World Winners` table to `'Taiwan'` where the `Year` column is equal to `'2015'`. This can be achieved using an `UPDATE` statement with a `WHERE` clause to filter the row based on the `Year` condition.\n\nThe correct SQL query to perform this operation is:\n\n```sql\nUPDATE `Miss World Winners` SET Represented = 'Taiwan' WHERE Year = '2015';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Miss World Winners` SET Represented = 'Taiwan' WHERE Year = '2015';\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The 'Represented' column has been successfully updated to 'Taiwan' for the year '2015' in the Miss World Winners table.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Athletic Achievements, and the headers of this table are Year,Competition,Venue,Position,Event.\nQuestion: In the Athletic Achievements table, the Position column will be updated to '2nd', where the Year column is '2003', the Competition column is 'World Championships', and the Event column is '3000 m st.'\nAssistant: The task is to update the `Position` column in the `Athletic Achievements` table to `'2nd'` where the `Year` is `'2003'`, the `Competition` is `'World Championships'`, and the `Event` is `'3000 m st.'`.
