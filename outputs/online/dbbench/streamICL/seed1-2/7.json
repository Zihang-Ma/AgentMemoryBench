I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

This can be achieved by sorting the `Joining year` in descending order and selecting the top result.\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT Association FROM `Football Teams` ORDER BY `Joining year` DESC LIMIT 1;\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Platform FROM `SWAT Games` WHERE Year > 2006 AND Developer = '3g studios';\"})\nTool: [('PlayStation Portable',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"PlayStation Portable\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam (IDFA), and the headers of this table are Year,Date (Opening),Date (Closing),Opening Film,Number of Screening,Award-Winning Film.\nQuestion: How many award-winning films have the opening film of encounters at the end of the world?\nAssistant: The question is asking for the count of award-winning films where the opening film is \"Encounters at the end of the world.\" To answer this, we need to query the `International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam (IDFA)` table and count the rows where the `Opening Film` column matches the specified title.\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) FROM `International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam (IDFA)` WHERE `Opening Film` = 'Encounters at the end of the world';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam (IDFA)` WHERE `Opening Film` = 'Encounters at the end of the world';\"})\nTool: [(1,)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"1\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Motorcycle Race Results, and the headers of this table are Rider,Manufacturer,Laps,Time/Retired,Grid.\nQuestion: What is the average number of laps with an accident time/retired, aprilia manufacturer and a grid of 27?\nAssistant: The question is asking for the average number of laps where the `Manufacturer` is 'Aprilia', the `Grid` is 27, and the `Time/Retired` indicates an accident (e.g., 'Retired' or 'Accident'). To answer this, we need to query the `Motorcycle Race Results` table and calculate the average of the `Laps` column for rows that meet these conditions.\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT AVG(Laps) FROM `Motorcycle Race Results` WHERE Manufacturer = 'Aprilia' AND Grid = 27 AND `Time/Retired` LIKE '%Retired%' OR `Time/Retired` LIKE '%Accident%';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT AVG(Laps) FROM `Motorcycle Race Results` WHERE Manufacturer = 'Aprilia' AND Grid = 27 AND (`Time/Retired` LIKE '%Retired%' OR `Time/Retired` LIKE '%Accident%');\"})\nTool: [(12.0,)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"12.0\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Tennis Matches, and the headers of this table are Outcome,Date,Tournament,Surface,Partnering,Opponent in the final,Score in the final.\nQuestion: how many surfaces are grass?\nAssistant: The question is asking for the number of rows in the `Tennis Matches` table where the `Surface` is 'grass'. To answer this, we need to query the `Tennis Matches` table and count the rows that meet this condition.\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) FROM `Tennis Matches` WHERE Surface = 'grass';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `Tennis Matches` WHERE Surface = 'grass';\"})\nTool: [(2,)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"2\"]})"
