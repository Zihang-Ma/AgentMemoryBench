I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

This is a straightforward `UPDATE` operation using the `WHERE` clause to filter the specific row(s).\n\nThe correct SQL query to perform this operation is:\n\n```sql\nUPDATE `player_recruitment` SET Club = 'Geelong' WHERE Pick = 21;\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `player_recruitment` SET Club = 'Geelong' WHERE Pick = 21;\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The club of the player recruitment with pick number 21 has been successfully changed to Geelong.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is NBA Draft History, and the headers of this table are Round,Pick,Player,Position,Nationality,School/Club Team.\nQuestion: first player picked who attended school in california\nAssistant: The task is to find the first player picked in the `NBA Draft History` table who attended a school in California. To do this, we need to query the table and filter the rows where the `School/Club Team` column contains a value indicating a school in California. We will then sort the results by `Pick` in ascending order and select the first row.\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT Player FROM `NBA Draft History` WHERE `School/Club Team` LIKE '%California%' ORDER BY Pick ASC LIMIT 1;\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Player FROM `NBA Draft History` WHERE `School/Club Team` LIKE '%California%' ORDER BY Pick ASC LIMIT 1;\"})\nTool: [('Michael Miley',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Michael Miley\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is table_14876228_1, and the headers of this table are Position,Team,Played,Wins,Draws,Losses,Scored,Conceded,Points.\nQuestion: Change the team for position 10 to Barcelona in table_14876228_1.\nAssistant: The task is to update the `table_14876228_1` table by setting the `Team` column to `'Barcelona'` where the `Position` is `10`. This is a straightforward `UPDATE` operation using the `WHERE` clause to filter the specific row(s).\n\nThe correct SQL query to perform this operation is:\n\n```sql\nUPDATE `table_14876228_1` SET Team = 'Barcelona' WHERE Position = 10;\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `table_14876228_1` SET Team = 'Barcelona' WHERE Position = 10;\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The team for position 10 in table_14876228_1 has been successfully changed to Barcelona.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Toronto Raptors Players, and the headers of this table are Player,No.,Nationality,Position,Years in Toronto,School/Club Team.\nQuestion: Change the 'School/Club Team' of Kyle Lowry in 'Toronto Raptors Players' to 'Cardinal Dougherty HS'.\nAssistant: The task is to update the `School/Club Team` column in the `Toronto Raptors Players` table to `'Cardinal Dougherty HS'` where the `Player` is `'Kyle Lowry'`. This is a straightforward `UPDATE` operation using the `WHERE` clause to filter the specific row.\n\nThe correct SQL query to perform this operation is:\n\n```sql\nUPDATE `Toronto Raptors Players` SET `School/Club Team` = 'Cardinal Dougherty HS' WHERE Player = 'Kyle Lowry';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Toronto Raptors Players` SET `School/Club Team` = 'Cardinal Dougherty HS' WHERE Player = 'Kyle Lowry';\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The 'School/Club Team' of Kyle Lowry in the 'Toronto Raptors Players' table has been successfully changed to 'Cardinal Dougherty HS'.\"]})"
