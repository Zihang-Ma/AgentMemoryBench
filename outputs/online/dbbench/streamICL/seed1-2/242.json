I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

To answer this, we need to query the table and calculate the average of the `First Elected` column for rows that meet these conditions.\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT AVG(`First Elected`) FROM `Maryland State Legislature Representatives` WHERE District = 11 AND Committee = 'environmental matters';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT AVG(`First Elected`) FROM `Maryland State Legislature Representatives` WHERE District = 11 AND Committee = 'environmental matters';\"})\nTool: [(2002.0,)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"2002.0\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Senators, and the headers of this table are Senator,Party,State,Religion.\nQuestion: Insert a new record into the Senators table with values for Senator as Mitt Romney, Party as Republican, State as Utah, and Religion as Mormon.\nAssistant: The task is to insert a new record into the `Senators` table with the specified values: `Senator` as `'Mitt Romney'`, `Party` as `'Republican'`, `State` as `'Utah'`, and `Religion` as `'Mormon'`. This is a straightforward `INSERT` operation.\n\nThe correct SQL query to perform this operation is:\n\n```sql\nINSERT INTO `Senators` (Senator, Party, State, Religion) VALUES ('Mitt Romney', 'Republican', 'Utah', 'Mormon');\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `Senators` (Senator, Party, State, Religion) VALUES ('Mitt Romney', 'Republican', 'Utah', 'Mormon');\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"A new record with Senator Mitt Romney, Party Republican, State Utah, and Religion Mormon has been successfully inserted into the Senators table.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Winners By Country, and the headers of this table are Winner,Country,Most Recent Win.\nQuestion: The `Winners By Country` table is being updated by adding the values '3' for `Winner`, 'Spain' for `Country`, and '2005' for `Most Recent Win`.\nAssistant: The task is to update the `Winners By Country` table by adding the values `'3'` for `Winner`, `'Spain'` for `Country`, and `'2005'` for `Most Recent Win`. This is an `INSERT` operation since the question mentions \"adding values\" to the table.\n\nThe correct SQL query to perform this operation is:\n\n```sql\nINSERT INTO `Winners By Country` (Winner, Country, Most Recent Win) VALUES ('3', 'Spain', '2005');\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `Winners By Country` (Winner, Country, Most Recent Win) VALUES ('3', 'Spain', '2005');\"})\nTool: 1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near 'Recent Win) VALUES ('3', 'Spain', '2005')' at line 1\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `Winners By Country` (Winner, Country, `Most Recent Win`) VALUES ('3', 'Spain', '2005');\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The values '3' for Winner, 'Spain' for Country, and '2005' for Most Recent Win have been successfully added to the Winners By Country table.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is baseball_game_results, and the headers of this table are Date,Opponent,Score,Loss,Record.\nQuestion: The baseball game results were inserted into the database with the following values: Date='Jun 2', Opponent='@ Angels', Score='5–3', Loss='Montefusco (4–2)', Record='17–33' using the query: INSERT INTO baseball_game_results (Date, Opponent, Score, Loss, Record) VALUES\nAssistant: The task is to insert a new row into the `baseball_game_results` table with the specified values: Date='Jun 2', Opponent='@ Angels', Score='5–3', Loss='Montefusco (4–2)', Record='17–33'.
