I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

Kennedy, published by Harper & Brothers in 1956 with ISBN 978-0060955441 was inserted into the book_table.\n\n\nHere are some examples of the task you have completed:\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Commemorative Sculptures, and the headers of this table are Title / individual commemorated,Location,Date,Sculptor.\nQuestion: Change the date and sculptor of the 'Commemorative Sculptures' titled 'Mahatma Gandhi' to '1948' and 'Unknown' respectively.\nAssistant: The task is to update the `Date` and `Sculptor` columns in the `Commemorative Sculptures` table to `'1948'` and `'Unknown'` respectively, where the `Title / individual commemorated` is `'Mahatma Gandhi'`. This can be achieved using an `UPDATE` statement with a `WHERE` clause to filter the specific row.\n\nThe correct SQL query to perform this operation is:\n\n```sql\nUPDATE `Commemorative Sculptures` SET Date = '1948', Sculptor = 'Unknown' WHERE `Title / individual commemorated` = 'Mahatma Gandhi';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Commemorative Sculptures` SET Date = '1948', Sculptor = 'Unknown' WHERE `Title / individual commemorated` = 'Mahatma Gandhi';\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The date and sculptor for the 'Commemorative Sculptures' titled 'Mahatma Gandhi' have been successfully changed to '1948' and 'Unknown' respectively.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Rugby Teams and Their Accomplishments, and the headers of this table are Team,Conf/Div,Champion,Runner-up,Semifinalist,Quarterfinalist.\nQuestion: The rugby team of Harvard was updated in `Rugby Teams and Their Accomplishments` by setting 'Champion' to '1 ( 2020 )' and 'Semifinalist' to '1 ( 2020 )'.\nAssistant: The task is to update the `Champion` and `Semifinalist` columns in the `Rugby Teams and Their Accomplishments` table for the team named `'Harvard'` by setting both to `'1 ( 2020 )'`. This is an `UPDATE` operation using the `WHERE` clause to filter the specific row.\n\nThe correct SQL query to perform this operation is:\n\n```sql\nUPDATE `Rugby Teams and Their Accomplishments` SET Champion = '1 ( 2020 )', Semifinalist = '1 ( 2020 )' WHERE Team = 'Harvard';\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Rugby Teams and Their Accomplishments` SET Champion = '1 ( 2020 )', Semifinalist = '1 ( 2020 )' WHERE Team = 'Harvard';\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The 'Champion' and 'Semifinalist' entries for the Harvard rugby team in the 'Rugby Teams and Their Accomplishments' table have been successfully updated to '1 ( 2020 )'.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Senators, and the headers of this table are Senator,Party,State,Religion.\nQuestion: Insert a new record into the Senators table with values for Senator as Mitt Romney, Party as Republican, State as Utah, and Religion as Mormon.\nAssistant: The task is to insert a new record into the `Senators` table with the specified values: `Senator` as `'Mitt Romney'`, `Party` as `'Republican'`, `State` as `'Utah'`, and `Religion` as `'Mormon'`. This is a straightforward `INSERT` operation.\n\nThe correct SQL query to perform this operation is:\n\n```sql\nINSERT INTO `Senators` (Senator, Party, State, Religion) VALUES ('Mitt Romney', 'Republican', 'Utah', 'Mormon');\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `Senators` (Senator, Party, State, Religion) VALUES ('Mitt Romney', 'Republican', 'Utah', 'Mormon');\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"A new record with Senator Mitt Romney, Party Republican, State Utah, and Religion Mormon has been successfully inserted into the Senators table.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is SWAT Games, and the headers of this table are Title,Year,Platform,Developer,Publisher.\nQuestion: Name the plaform for year more than 2006 and developer of 3g studios\nAssistant: The question asks for the association that entered last, which means we need to find the association with the most recent `Joining year`. This can be achieved by sorting the `Joining year` in descending order and selecting the top result.\n\nThe correct SQL query to achieve this is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT Association FROM `Football Teams` ORDER BY `Joining year` DESC LIMIT 1;\n```\n\nI will now execute this SQL query.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Platform FROM `SWAT Games` WHERE Year > 2006 AND Developer = '3g studios';\"})\nTool: [('PlayStation Portable',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"PlayStation Portable\"]})"
