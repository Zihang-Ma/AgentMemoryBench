I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

Verify the insertion by checking if the values {team1}, {agg}, {team2}, {leg1}, and {leg2} are present in the table.\n\nGiven that we need to find the total pick number for players in a specific position from a specific team, this workflow filters and sums the required values.\nSELECT * FROM {table_name} WHERE {query_conditions}\nSUM({column_to_sum}) AS total_pick_number\n\nGiven that the task involves verifying the insertion of a new row into the `baseball_game_results` table, this workflow checks if the new record is present.\n[step 1 description with {variable} placeholders]\nSELECT * FROM baseball_game_results WHERE Date = '{Date}' AND Opponent = '{Opponent}' AND Score = '{Score}' AND Loss = '{Loss}' AND Record = '{Record}'\n[step 2 description with {variable} placeholders]\n...\n\nGiven that the task is to update specific fields in the Game Statistics table, this workflow updates the high points and high rebounds for a given game.

[step 2 description with {high_points} and {high_rebounds} placeholders] Update the High points and High rebounds columns in the identified row to {high_points} and {high_rebounds} respectively.\n\nGiven that we need to update the points of a specific team in the standings table, this workflow describes the process of locating and updating the row.\nSELECT * FROM standings WHERE Name = \\\"{team_name}\\\"\nUPDATE standings SET Points = \\\"{new_points}\\\" WHERE Name = \\\"{team_name}\\\"\n\nIdentify the row in the 'Team Information' table where the 'Team' column matches the {team_name}. Update the 'Capacity' column of the identified row to the {new_capacity}.\n\nGiven that the task is to retrieve the attendance for a specific tie number from the `Football Matches` table, this workflow involves executing a corrected SQL query.\n"
