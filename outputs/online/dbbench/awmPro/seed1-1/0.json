I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

Result,Opponent,Method,Event,Notes.\nQuestion: What are the Notes when the Method is decision?\n\n\nHere are some useful workflows learned from past similar episodes, you can use them to help you complete the task:\nGiven that the table does not exist and needs to be created, this workflow creates the Athlete Results table with the specified headers.\nCREATE TABLE Athlete_Results (\n    Year VARCHAR,\n    Competition VARCHAR,\n    Venue VARCHAR,\n    Position VARCHAR,\n    Event VARCHAR,\n    Notes VARCHAR\n);\n\n[step 2 description: Insert the new row with the provided values]\nINSERT INTO Athlete_Results (Year, Competition, Venue, Position, Event, Notes)\nVALUES ('2018', 'Lisbon Half Marathon', 'Lisbon, Portugal', '1st', 'Half marathon', '1:09:12');\n\nGiven that there might be multiple rows for a specific dance in the \\\"Dance Competition Results\\\" table, this workflow handles updating the \\\"Best score\\\" for all relevant rows.\n[step 1 description with {dance_name} and {table_name} placeholders]\n- Locate all rows in the {table_name} table where the \\\"Dance\\\" column is equal to {dance_name}.\n[step 2 description with {dance_name} and {new_score} placeholders]\n- Update the \\\"Best score\\\" column of all located rows for {dance_name} to {new_score}.\n\nGiven that the task involves verifying the insertion of a new row into the `baseball_game_results` table, this workflow checks if the new record is present.\n[step 1 description with {variable} placeholders]\nSELECT * FROM baseball_game_results WHERE Date = '{Date}' AND Opponent = '{Opponent}' AND Score = '{Score}' AND Loss = '{Loss}' AND Record = '{Record}'\n[step 2 description with {variable} placeholders]\n...\n\nGiven that we need to find the result of a specific game in the `Hockey_Game_Results` table, this workflow extracts the relevant information.\n[step 1 description with {date}, {team1}, {team2} placeholders]\nsql\nSELECT * FROM Hockey_Game_Results WHERE Date = '{date}' AND (Winning Team = '{team1}' OR Winning Team = '{team2}')\n\n[step 2 description with {winning_team} placeholder]\nDetermine the {winning_team} based on the query result.\n\nGiven that the task is to update the \"Tour de France Winners by Stage\" table with specific data, this workflow inserts the new data into the table.\n[step 1 description with {year}, {stage}, {start_of_stage}, {distance_km}, {category_of_climb}, {stage_winner}, {nationality}, {yellow_jersey}, {bend} placeholders]\n- Insert a new row into the \"Tour de France Winners by Stage\" table with the values: {year} = 1998, {stage} = 20, {start_of_stage} = Aix-les-Bains, {distance_km} = 149.5, {category_of_climb} = HC, {stage_winner} = Marco Pantani, {nationality} = Italy, {yellow_jersey} = Marco Pantani, {bend} = 25.\n\nINSERT INTO Basketball_Tournament_Stats (Tournament, Games_played, Points_per_game, Rebounds_per_game, Assists_per_game) VALUES ('2015 EuroBasket', {games_played},

EuroBasket', 8, 9.1, 7.2, 1.9);\n\nGiven that we need to update specific tournament results in a table, this workflow updates the results for a given tournament across multiple years.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the row for the specified tournament\nIdentify the row in the \"Tournament Results by Year\" table where the `Tournament` column is equal to {tournament_name}.\n\n### Step 2: Update the results for the specified years\nUpdate the corresponding year columns with the new values: {year_values} to {updated_values}.\n\nFor example:\n- {tournament_name} = 'Australian Open'\n- {year_values} = ['2006', '2007', '2008', '2009', '2011', '2012']\n- {updated_values} = ['QF', 'SF', 'F', 'A', 'A', 'A']\n\nGiven that the task involves verifying the existence of a specific medal winner in the 'Medal Winners' table, this workflow checks if the record exists based on the event details.\n[step 1 description with {event}, {table}, and {date} placeholders]\nSELECT * FROM {table} WHERE Sport = 'Cross-country skiing' AND Event = '{event}' AND Medal = 'Gold' AND Date = '{date}';\n[step 2 description with {name} placeholder]\n-- If the record exists, update the name\nUPDATE {table} SET Name = '{name}' WHERE Sport = 'Cross-country skiing' AND Event = '{event}' AND Medal = 'Gold' AND Date = '{date}';\n\nGiven that the task is to insert a new row into the `baseball_game_results` table, this workflow inserts the specified values into the table.\n[step 1 description with {variable} placeholders]\nINSERT INTO baseball_game_results (Date, Opponent, Score, Loss, Record) VALUES ('{Date}', '{Opponent}', '{Score}', '{Loss}', '{Record}')\n[step 2 description with {variable} placeholders]\n[step 3 description with {variable} placeholders]\n...\n\nGiven that we have the query result from the `Hockey_Game_Results` table, this workflow checks if a specific team won the game.\n[step 1 description with {winning_team}, {team1}, {team2} placeholders]\nCheck if the {winning_team} is either {team1} or {team2}.\n[step 2 description with {result} placeholder]\nIf {winning_team} is {team1}, then {result} is 'Dallas won the game.' If {winning_team} is {team2}, then {result} is 'Ottawa won the game.'\n"
