I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

Apply the condition to only update records where `Rank` is for male swimmers, `Event` is 200m backstroke, and `Nationality` is Russia.\n\nGiven that the task is to update the \"Tour de France Winners by Stage\" table with specific data, this workflow inserts the new data into the table.\n[step 1 description with {year}, {stage}, {start_of_stage}, {distance_km}, {category_of_climb}, {stage_winner}, {nationality}, {yellow_jersey}, {bend} placeholders]\n- Insert a new row into the \"Tour de France Winners by Stage\" table with the values: {year} = 1998, {stage} = 20, {start_of_stage} = Aix-les-Bains, {distance_km} = 149.5, {category_of_climb} = HC, {stage_winner} = Marco Pantani, {nationality} = Italy, {yellow_jersey} = Marco Pantani, {bend} = 25.\n\nIdentify the record in the Actress_Filmography table where Notes are set to '-' and retrieve its {record_id}. Update the identified record with the new values: Year set to '2008', Title set to 'Sorority House Massacre 2', Role set to 'Hannah', and Notes set to 'Video'.\n\nInsert the new airport entry with the details: {country} (Australia), {province_state} (New South Wales), {city} (Sydney), and {airport_name} (Sydney Kingsford Smith International Airport) into the table {table_name} (Airport locations by country). Verify the insertion by checking the updated table for the new entry.\n\nGiven that the task is to insert a new record into the Senators table, this workflow describes the process of adding a new entry with specified details.\n[step 1 description with {senator_name}, {party}, {state}, and {religion} placeholders]\n[step 2 description with {table_name} placeholder]\n\n### Example Steps:\n1. Prepare the SQL insert statement with the values {senator_name} = 'Mitt Romney', {party} = 'Republican', {state} = 'Utah', and {religion} = 'Mormon' for the table {table_name} = 'Senators'.\n2. Execute the SQL insert statement to add the new record to the {table_name}.\n\nUpdate the basketball_coaches table to set the coach to 'Bob Huggins' and the school to 'West Virginia' for the year {year}. Verify the update by selecting the relevant row from the basketball_coaches table where the year is {year}.\n\nInsert 'Jane Smith' into the Alumni table with 'Theo' for School, 'PhD' for Degree, '2010' for Year, and 'Theology professor' for Description.\n\nInsert information about a specific state park into the State Parks Table with values for the columns.\n"
