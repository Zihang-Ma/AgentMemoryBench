Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer.

Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

[step 1 description with {game_id} placeholder] Identify the row in the Game Statistics table where the Game column matches {game_id}. [step 2 description with {high_points} and {high_rebounds} placeholders] Update the High points and High rebounds columns in the identified row to {high_points} and {high_rebounds} respectively.\n\nUpdate the NBA Playoff History table for the Los Angeles Clippers. [step 1 description with {team_name} and {seasons_since_win} placeholders] Update the 'Team' column to {team_name} and the 'Seasons since win' column to {seasons_since_win}. [step 2 description with {last_series_win} placeholder] Update the 'Last series win in NBA Playoffs' column to {last_series_win}. [step 3 description with {losing_streak} and {series_losses_teams} placeholders] Update the 'Losing streak' column to {losing_streak} and the 'Series losses - teams' column to {series_losses_teams}.\n\nConstruct the SQL update statement with the pick number and new club name. The statement should look like: \\nUPDATE player_recruitment SET Recruited_from = 'Geelong' WHERE Pick = 21;\\nExecute the constructed SQL update statement to modify the database.\n\nGiven that we need to update the points of a specific team in the standings table, this workflow describes the process of locating and updating the row.\nSELECT * FROM standings WHERE Name = \\\"{team_name}\\\"\nUPDATE standings SET Points = \\\"{new_points}\\\" WHERE Name = \\\"{team_name}\\\"\n\nIdentify the row for the specified team: Use a SQL query to find the row where the Team column matches {team_name}. Update the specified fields: Use a SQL update statement to set the Champion and Semifinalist columns to {field1} and {field2} respectively, for the identified row.\n\nInsert the values {team1}, {agg}, {team2}, {leg1}, and {leg2} into the 'Football Match Results' table. Verify the insertion by checking if the values {team1}, {agg}, {team2}, {leg1}, and {leg2} are present in the table.\n\nIdentify the row where the `Game` column is equal to {game_number}. Update the `Opponent` column of the identified row to {new_opponent}.\n\nIdentify the row in the Champions League Qualification History table where the club name is {club_name}. Update the columns 'Last Champions League Qualification', 'Method of Qualification', and 'Length of drought' with the values {last_qualification}, {qualification_method}, and {drought_length}, respectively.\n\nGiven that the task is to find the average finish for a specific position in the Racing Stats table, this workflow filters the table by the given position and calculates the average finish.\n[step 1 description: Filter the Racing Stats table by the position 70]\nSELECT Avg_Finish FROM Racing_Stats WHERE Position = 70\n[step 2 description: Calculate the average finish from the filtered results]\nSELECT AVG(Avg_Finish) FROM (SELECT Avg_Finish FROM Racing_Stats WHERE Position = 70) AS FilteredResults\n\nUpdate the name in the draft_picks table where the name is 'John Smith' to 'Johnny Smith'\n"
