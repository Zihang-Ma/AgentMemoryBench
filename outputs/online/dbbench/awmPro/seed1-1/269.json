I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

Verify the update by selecting the relevant row from the basketball_coaches table where the year is {year}.\n\nGiven that there might be multiple rows for a specific dance in the \\\"Dance Competition Results\\\" table, this workflow handles updating the \\\"Best score\\\" for all relevant rows.\n[step 1 description with {dance_name} and {table_name} placeholders]\n- Locate all rows in the {table_name} table where the \\\"Dance\\\" column is equal to {dance_name}.\n[step 2 description with {dance_name} and {new_score} placeholders]\n- Update the \\\"Best score\\\" column of all located rows for {dance_name} to {new_score}.\n\nGiven that we need to update specific tournament results in a table, this workflow updates the results for a given tournament across multiple years.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the row for the specified tournament\nIdentify the row in the \"Tournament Results by Year\" table where the `Tournament` column is equal to {tournament_name}.\n\n### Step 2: Update the results for the specified years\nUpdate the corresponding year columns with the new values: {year_values} to {updated_values}.\n\nFor example:\n- {tournament_name} = 'Australian Open'\n- {year_values} = ['2006', '2007', '2008', '2009', '2011', '2012']\n- {updated_values} = ['QF', 'SF', 'F', 'A', 'A', 'A']\n\nIdentify the row in the table {table_name} where the Rank is equal to {rank}. Update the Lake(s) column of the identified row to {lake}.\n\nConstruct the SQL update statement with the pick number and new club name. The statement should look like: \\nUPDATE player_recruitment SET Recruited_from = 'Geelong' WHERE Pick = 21;\\nExecute the constructed SQL update statement to modify the database.\n\nGiven that the task is to update the 'Runs' attribute in the 'CricketPlayers' table for a specific player, this workflow updates the 'Runs' value.\n[step 1 description: Query the 'CricketPlayers' table to find the row where 'Player' is 'Tom Smith']\nSELECT * FROM CricketPlayers WHERE Player = 'Tom Smith'\n[step 2 description: Update the 'Runs' attribute to 200 for the found row]\nUPDATE CricketPlayers SET Runs = 200 WHERE Player = 'Tom Smith'\n\nGiven that we need to update the best score of a specific dance in the \\\"Dance Competition Results\\\" table, this workflow locates and updates the row(s) for the specified dance.\n[step 1 description with {dance_name} and {table_name} placeholders]\n- Locate the row(s) in the {table_name} table where the \\\"Dance\\\" column is equal to {dance_name}.\n[step 2 description with {dance_name} and {new_score} placeholders]\n- Update the \\\"Best score\\\" column of the located row(s) for {dance_name} to {new_score}.\n\nGiven that the task is to insert data into the 'Athlete Results' table, this workflow handles the insertion process.\n[step 1 description with {year}, {competition}, {venue}, {event}, {position}, {notes} placeholders]\nINSERT INTO Athlete_Results (Year, Competition, Venue, Position, Event, Notes) VALUES ({year}, {competition}, {venue}, {position}, {event}, {notes});\n[step 2 description with {year}, {competition}, {venue}, {event}, {position}, {notes} placeholders]\nVerify the insertion by selecting the inserted row.\nSELECT * FROM Athlete_Results WHERE Year = {year} AND Competition = {competition} AND Venue = {venue} AND Position = {position} AND Event = {event} AND Notes = {notes};\n"
