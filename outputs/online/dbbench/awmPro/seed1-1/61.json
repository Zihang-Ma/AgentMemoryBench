I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

Verify the insertion by checking if the values {team1}, {agg}, {team2}, {leg1}, and {leg2} are present in the table.\n\nGiven that the table does not exist and needs to be created, this workflow creates the Athlete Results table with the specified headers.\nCREATE TABLE Athlete_Results (\n    Year VARCHAR,\n    Competition VARCHAR,\n    Venue VARCHAR,\n    Position VARCHAR,\n    Event VARCHAR,\n    Notes VARCHAR\n);\n\n[step 2 description: Insert the new row with the provided values]\nINSERT INTO Athlete_Results (Year, Competition, Venue, Position, Event, Notes)\nVALUES ('2018', 'Lisbon Half Marathon', 'Lisbon, Portugal', '1st', 'Half marathon', '1:09:12');\n\nGiven that the task is to determine if a specific team took first place in a given year, this workflow checks if the team is present in the filtered results.\n[step 1 description with {team_name} and {year} placeholders]\n- Filter the rows in the AFL Cairns Grand Final Results table where the Year column matches the {year}.\n[step 2 description with {team_name} placeholder]\n- Check if the {team_name} is listed in the Premiers column of the filtered rows.\n\nGiven that the task is to find the team that took first place in a specific year from the AFL Cairns Grand Final Results table, this workflow extracts the team name for a given year.\n[step 1 description with {year} placeholder]\n- Filter the rows in the AFL Cairns Grand Final Results table where the Year column matches the {year}.\n[step 2 description with {year} placeholder]\n- From the filtered rows, select the team name listed in the Premiers column.\n\nIdentify the row in the 'Team Information' table where the 'Team' column matches the {team_name}.
