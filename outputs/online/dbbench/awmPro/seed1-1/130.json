I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

Verify the insertion by querying the sports_venues table for the new record with Venue = {venue_name}, Sports = {sport_type}, and Capacity = {capacity}.\n\nGiven that the task is to insert data into the Schools table, this workflow describes how to perform the insertion.\ninstitution = 'Aquinas'\nlocation = 'La Crosse'\naffiliation = 'Private'\nenrollment = '312'\nmascot = 'Blugolds'\ncolors = 'Navy and gold'\nExecute the SQL command: INSERT INTO Schools (Institution, Location, Affiliation, Enrollment, Mascot, Colors) VALUES (\\\"{institution}\\\", \\\"{location}\\\", \\\"{affiliation}\\\", \\\"{enrollment}\\\", \\\"{mascot}\\\", \\\"{colors}\\\")\n\nInsert the new airport entry with the details: {country} (Australia), {province_state} (New South Wales), {city} (Sydney), and {airport_name} (Sydney Kingsford Smith International Airport) into the table {table_name} (Airport locations by country). Verify the insertion by checking the updated table for the new entry.\n\nInsert the record with the following details into the 'Library Locations' table:\\n- Branch: {branch_name}\\n- Address: {address}\\n- Neighborhood: {neighborhood}\\n- First branch opened: {first_opened}\\n- Current branch opened: {current_opened}\\nVerify the insertion by querying the 'Library Locations' table for the {branch_name} to ensure the record was added successfully.\n\nGiven that the task is to insert a new record into the `music_catalog` table with specific values, this workflow describes how to perform the insertion.\n[step 1 description with {year}, {title}, {label}, {format} placeholders]\nINSERT INTO music_catalog (Year, Title, Label, Format) VALUES ('{year}', '{title}', '{label}', '{format}')\n[step 2 description with {year}, {title}, {label}, {format} placeholders]\nVerify the insertion by selecting the record with the given title.\nSELECT * FROM music_catalog WHERE Title = '{title}' AND Year = '{year}'\n\nUpdate the `Name` column to `{new_name}` in the table `{table_name}`. Apply the condition to only update records where `Rank` is for male swimmers, `Event` is 200m backstroke, and `Nationality` is Russia.\n\nUpdate the 'Team' column to 'Barcelona' in the table {table_name} where the 'Position' is {position}.\\nExecute the SQL query: UPDATE {table_name} SET Team = 'Barcelona' WHERE Position = {position};\n\nGiven that the task is to add a new row to the 'Airport Information' table, this workflow uses an SQL INSERT INTO statement to accomplish the insertion.\nINSERT INTO {table_name} (City, Country, Airport, IATA, ICAO) VALUES ('{city}', '{country}', '{airport}', '{iata}', '{icao}');\n\nConstruct the SQL update statement with the pick number and new club name. The statement should look like: \\nUPDATE player_recruitment SET Recruited_from = 'Geelong' WHERE Pick = 21;\\nExecute the constructed SQL update statement to modify the database.\n"
