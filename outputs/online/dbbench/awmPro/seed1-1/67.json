I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

Update the \"Diameter ( km )\" column of the located row to {new_diameter}.\n\nInsert the new airport entry with the details: {country} (Australia), {province_state} (New South Wales), {city} (Sydney), and {airport_name} (Sydney Kingsford Smith International Airport) into the table {table_name} (Airport locations by country). Verify the insertion by checking the updated table for the new entry.\n\nGiven that there might be multiple rows for a specific dance in the \\\"Dance Competition Results\\\" table, this workflow handles updating the \\\"Best score\\\" for all relevant rows.\n[step 1 description with {dance_name} and {table_name} placeholders]\n- Locate all rows in the {table_name} table where the \\\"Dance\\\" column is equal to {dance_name}.\n[step 2 description with {dance_name} and {new_score} placeholders]\n- Update the \\\"Best score\\\" column of all located rows for {dance_name} to {new_score}.\n\nGiven that the task is to update the \\\"Area of Operation\\\" for a specific client in the \\\"Oil Companies Operations\\\" table, this workflow identifies and modifies the row with the given client name.\n[step 1 description with {client_name} placeholder]\n[step 2 description with {new_area} placeholder]\n\n### Steps:\n1. Identify the row in the \\\"Oil Companies Operations\\\" table where the \\\"Client\\\" is equal to {client_name}.\n2. Update the \\\"Area of Operation\\\" column of the identified row to {new_area}.\n\nGiven that the task is to find the fewest number of games played in the `football_standings` table, this workflow retrieves the minimum value from the `Games played` column.\n[step 1 description with {table_name} and {column_name} placeholders]\nsql\nSELECT MIN({column_name}) FROM {table_name};\n[step 2 description with {result_variable} placeholder]\npython\nresult = cursor.fetchone()[0]\n\nGiven that we need to extract the gold medal counts for specific nations from a table, this workflow extracts the required data.\n[step 1 description with {table_name} and {nation_list} placeholders]\n[step 2 description with {nation_list} and {gold_column} placeholders]\n\nIdentify the row with the {row_number} in the 'Papal Encyclicals Table'.
