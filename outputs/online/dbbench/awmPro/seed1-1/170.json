I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

Verify the insertion by checking the updated table for the new entry.\n\nLocate the row in the {table_name} where the crater name is {crater_name}. Update the \"Diameter ( km )\" column of the located row to {new_diameter}.\n\nLocate the row in the 'Irish Counties and Cities' table where the 'County or City' is {county} and update the 'NUTS 3 Region' column to 'Midlands Region'.\\nUpdate the 'NUTS 3 Region' column of the located row to 'Midlands Region'.\n\nGiven that the task is to add a new row to the 'Airport Information' table, this workflow uses an SQL INSERT INTO statement to accomplish the insertion.\nINSERT INTO {table_name} (City, Country, Airport, IATA, ICAO) VALUES ('{city}', '{country}', '{airport}', '{iata}', '{icao}');\n\nSearch for the row in the 'Irish Counties and Cities' table where the 'County or City' is {county}.\\nReturn the row details if found.\n\nExtract the school website column from the Schools Information table\nWHERE `School website` = 'http://www.camp.herts.sch.uk/'\n\nGiven that we need to update a specific record in the `Institutions` table, this workflow locates and updates the record based on the institution name.\n[step 1 description with {institution_name} and {new_status} placeholders]\n[step 2 description with {institution_name} and {new_status} placeholders]\n\n1. Locate the row in the `Institutions` table where the `Institution` is `{institution_name}`.\n2. Update the `Status` column of the located row to `{new_status}`.\n\nGiven that the task is to insert data into the 'Athlete Results' table, this workflow handles the insertion process.\n[step 1 description with {year}, {competition}, {venue}, {event}, {position}, {notes} placeholders]\nINSERT INTO Athlete_Results (Year, Competition, Venue, Position, Event, Notes) VALUES ({year}, {competition}, {venue}, {position}, {event}, {notes});\n[step 2 description with {year}, {competition}, {venue}, {event}, {position}, {notes} placeholders]\nVerify the insertion by selecting the inserted row.\nSELECT * FROM Athlete_Results WHERE Year = {year} AND Competition = {competition} AND Venue = {venue} AND Position = {position} AND Event = {event} AND Notes = {notes};\n\nExecute the SQL UPDATE statement to set the Notes column to 'Released' and the Role column to 'Todd' in the Filmography table. Apply the WHERE clause to target rows where the Title column is equal to 'Chaos Walking'.\n\nConstruct the SQL update statement with the pick number and new club name. The statement should look like: \\nUPDATE player_recruitment SET Recruited_from = 'Geelong' WHERE Pick = 21;\\nExecute the constructed SQL update statement to modify the database.\n"
