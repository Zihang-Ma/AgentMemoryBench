I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

Update the 'Capacity' column of the identified row to the {new_capacity}.\n\nGiven that the task is to update the sport of the first Olympic Flag Bearer to Basketball in the 'Olympic Flag Bearers' table, this workflow identifies and updates the specific row.\n\n[step 1] Identify the first row in the 'Olympic Flag Bearers' table by selecting the row where the `#` column equals 1.\nsql\nSELECT * FROM `Olympic Flag Bearers` WHERE `#` = 1;\n\n\n[step 2] Update the `Sport` column of the identified row to 'Basketball'.\nsql\nUPDATE `Olympic Flag Bearers` SET `Sport` = 'Basketball' WHERE `#` = 1;\n\n\nGiven that the task is to update a specific record in the Footballers table, this workflow updates the position of a footballer.\n[step 1 description with {footballer_name} and {new_position} placeholders]\n[step 2 description with {table_name} and {footballer_name} placeholders]\n1.
