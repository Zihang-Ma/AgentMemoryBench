I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

Apply the condition to only update records where `Rank` is for male swimmers, `Event` is 200m backstroke, and `Nationality` is Russia.\n\nInsert the new airport entry with the details: {country} (Australia), {province_state} (New South Wales), {city} (Sydney), and {airport_name} (Sydney Kingsford Smith International Airport) into the table {table_name} (Airport locations by country). Verify the insertion by checking the updated table for the new entry.\n\nGiven that the task involves updating a specific entry in a table, this workflow is designed to modify a value in a database table based on a given condition.\n\n[step 1] Identify the table and the specific row to update. In this case, the table is {table_name} and the row to update is identified by the {building_name}.\n\n[step 2] Update the specified column in the identified row. Here, the column to update is {column_name} and the new value is {new_value}.\n\nUpdate the basketball_coaches table to set the coach to 'Bob Huggins' and the school to 'West Virginia' for the year {year}. Verify the update by selecting the relevant row from the basketball_coaches table where the year is {year}.\n\nGiven that the task is to update the theme of a specific event in a table, this workflow locates the event and updates its theme.\n1. Locate the row in the 'Central European Jamboree' table where the 'Year' is {year}.\n2. Update the 'Theme' column of the located row to {new_theme}.\n\nGiven that the task involves extracting information about a TV show from the Acting Credits table, this workflow focuses on filtering the relevant data.\n[step 1 description with {year}, {title}, and {role} placeholders]\n\\nsql\nSELECT * FROM Acting_Credits WHERE Year = {year} AND Title = {title} AND Role = {role};\\n\\n[step 2 description with {main_role} placeholder]\n\\nsql\nFILTER BY Main_Role = {main_role};\n\nGiven that there might be multiple rows for a specific dance in the \\\"Dance Competition Results\\\" table, this workflow handles updating the \\\"Best score\\\" for all relevant rows.\n[step 1 description with {dance_name} and {table_name} placeholders]\n- Locate all rows in the {table_name} table where the \\\"Dance\\\" column is equal to {dance_name}.\n[step 2 description with {dance_name} and {new_score} placeholders]\n- Update the \\\"Best score\\\" column of all located rows for {dance_name} to {new_score}.\n\nLocate the row in the 'Irish Counties and Cities' table where the 'County or City' is {county} and update the 'NUTS 3 Region' column to 'Midlands Region'.\\nUpdate the 'NUTS 3 Region' column of the located row to 'Midlands Region'.\n\nGiven that the task is to update a specific column value in a table based on a condition, this workflow updates the desired column.\n[step 1 description with {table_name} and {column_name} placeholders]\n[step 2 description with {table_name}, {column_name}, and {value} placeholders]\n\n### Example Workflow Steps\n1. Identify the table named {table_name} which has the headers {table_headers}.\n2. Update the value in the {column_name} column to {new_value} where the {identifier_column} is equal to {identifier_value}.\n"
