I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

It is being added to the public transportation lines table.\n\n\nHere are some useful workflows learned from past similar episodes, you can use them to help you complete the task:\nSearch for the row in the 'Irish Counties and Cities' table where the 'County or City' is {county}.\\nReturn the row details if found.\n\nIdentify the row in the Champions League Qualification History table where the club name is {club_name}. Update the columns 'Last Champions League Qualification', 'Method of Qualification', and 'Length of drought' with the values {last_qualification}, {qualification_method}, and {drought_length}, respectively.\n\nGiven that there might be multiple rows for a specific dance in the \\\"Dance Competition Results\\\" table, this workflow handles updating the \\\"Best score\\\" for all relevant rows.\n[step 1 description with {dance_name} and {table_name} placeholders]\n- Locate all rows in the {table_name} table where the \\\"Dance\\\" column is equal to {dance_name}.\n[step 2 description with {dance_name} and {new_score} placeholders]\n- Update the \\\"Best score\\\" column of all located rows for {dance_name} to {new_score}.\n\nGiven that the task is to update the theme of a specific event in a table, this workflow locates the event and updates its theme.\n1. Locate the row in the 'Central European Jamboree' table where the 'Year' is {year}.\n2. Update the 'Theme' column of the located row to {new_theme}.\n\nLocate the row in the 'Irish Counties and Cities' table where the 'County or City' is {county} and update the 'NUTS 3 Region' column to 'Midlands Region'.\\nUpdate the 'NUTS 3 Region' column of the located row to 'Midlands Region'.\n\nInsert the new airport entry with the details: {country} (Australia), {province_state} (New South Wales), {city} (Sydney), and {airport_name} (Sydney Kingsford Smith International Airport) into the table {table_name} (Airport locations by country). Verify the insertion by checking the updated table for the new entry.\n\nGiven that we need to extract the gold medal counts for specific nations from a table, this workflow extracts the required data.\n[step 1 description with {table_name} and {nation_list} placeholders]\n[step 2 description with {nation_list} and {gold_column} placeholders]\n\nGiven that the task is to update the city name in a specific row of the 'Airport Passengers' table, this workflow updates the city for a given rank.\n[step 1] Execute an SQL `SELECT` statement to find the row with the specified rank: `SELECT * FROM Airport_Passengers WHERE Rank = {rank}`\n[step 2] Execute an SQL `UPDATE` statement to change the city name: `UPDATE Airport_Passengers SET City = 'Haarlemmermeer' WHERE Rank = {rank}`\n\nLocate the row in the {table_name} where the crater name is {crater_name}. Update the \"Diameter ( km )\" column of the located row to {new_diameter}.\n\nGiven that we need to update the best score of a specific dance in the \\\"Dance Competition Results\\\" table, this workflow locates and updates the row(s) for the specified dance.\n[step 1 description with {dance_name} and {table_name} placeholders]\n- Locate the row(s) in the {table_name} table where the \\\"Dance\\\" column is equal to {dance_name}.\n[step 2 description with {dance_name} and {new_score} placeholders]\n- Update the \\\"Best score\\\" column of the located row(s) for {dance_name} to {new_score}.\n"
