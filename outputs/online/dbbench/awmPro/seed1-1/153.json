I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

Verify the insertion by querying the sports_venues table for the new record with Venue = {venue_name}, Sports = {sport_type}, and Capacity = {capacity}.\n\nInsert the new airport entry with the details: {country} (Australia), {province_state} (New South Wales), {city} (Sydney), and {airport_name} (Sydney Kingsford Smith International Airport) into the table {table_name} (Airport locations by country). Verify the insertion by checking the updated table for the new entry.\n\nGiven that the task is to insert data into the 'Athlete Results' table, this workflow handles the insertion process.\n[step 1 description with {year}, {competition}, {venue}, {event}, {position}, {notes} placeholders]\nINSERT INTO Athlete_Results (Year, Competition, Venue, Position, Event, Notes) VALUES ({year}, {competition}, {venue}, {position}, {event}, {notes});\n[step 2 description with {year}, {competition}, {venue}, {event}, {position}, {notes} placeholders]\nVerify the insertion by selecting the inserted row.\nSELECT * FROM Athlete_Results WHERE Year = {year} AND Competition = {competition} AND Venue = {venue} AND Position = {position} AND Event = {event} AND Notes = {notes};\n\nInsert the values {team1}, {agg}, {team2}, {leg1}, and {leg2} into the 'Football Match Results' table. Verify the insertion by checking if the values {team1}, {agg}, {team2}, {leg1}, and {leg2} are present in the table.\n\nGiven that the task is to add a new row to the 'Airport Information' table, this workflow uses an SQL INSERT INTO statement to accomplish the insertion.\nINSERT INTO {table_name} (City, Country, Airport, IATA, ICAO) VALUES ('{city}', '{country}', '{airport}', '{iata}', '{icao}');\n\nInsert the record with the following details into the 'Library Locations' table:\\n- Branch: {branch_name}\\n- Address: {address}\\n- Neighborhood: {neighborhood}\\n- First branch opened: {first_opened}\\n- Current branch opened: {current_opened}\\nVerify the insertion by querying the 'Library Locations' table for the {branch_name} to ensure the record was added successfully.\n\nGiven that the task is to insert a new location into the `Location Table`, this workflow handles the insertion process.\n[step 1 description with {location}, {km}, {mi}, {destinations}, and {notes} placeholders]\n[step 2 description with {location}, {km}, {mi}, {destinations}, and {notes} placeholders]\n\n### Steps:\n1. Prepare the data to be inserted: {location} with {km} kilometers, {mi} miles, {destinations} as destinations, and {notes} as notes.\n2. Execute the SQL insert statement into the `Location Table`: `INSERT INTO Location Table (Location, km, mi, Destinations, Notes) VALUES ('{location}', '{km}', '{mi}', '{destinations}', '{notes}')`.\n\nGiven that the task is to insert data into the Schools table, this workflow describes how to perform the insertion.\ninstitution = 'Aquinas'\nlocation = 'La Crosse'\naffiliation = 'Private'\nenrollment = '312'\nmascot = 'Blugolds'\ncolors = 'Navy and gold'\nExecute the SQL command: INSERT INTO Schools (Institution, Location, Affiliation, Enrollment, Mascot, Colors) VALUES (\\\"{institution}\\\", \\\"{location}\\\", \\\"{affiliation}\\\", \\\"{enrollment}\\\", \\\"{mascot}\\\", \\\"{colors}\\\")\n\nGiven that the task is to insert a record into the 'Athlete Performances' table, this workflow describes the process of inserting a new row with specific values.\n[step 1 description: Prepare the SQL insert statement with placeholders for the values]\nINSERT INTO Athlete_Performances (Year, Competition, Venue, Position, Event, Notes) VALUES ({year}, {competition}, {venue}, {position}, {event}, {notes});\n[step 2 description: Execute the SQL insert statement]\nEXECUTE the_prepared_sql_statement;\n\nINSERT INTO Basketball_Tournament_Stats (Tournament, Games_played, Points_per_game, Rebounds_per_game, Assists_per_game) VALUES ('2015 EuroBasket', {games_played}, {points_per_game}, {rebounds_per_game}, {assists_per_game});\\nINSERT INTO Basketball_Tournament_Stats (Tournament, Games_played, Points_per_game, Rebounds_per_game, Assists_per_game) VALUES ('2015 EuroBasket', 8, 9.1, 7.2, 1.9);\n"
