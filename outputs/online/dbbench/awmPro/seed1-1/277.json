I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

In this case, the table is {table_name} and the row to update is identified by the {building_name}.\n\n[step 2] Update the specified column in the identified row. Here, the column to update is {column_name} and the new value is {new_value}.\n\nGiven that the task is to update a specific column value in a table based on a condition, this workflow updates the desired column.\n[step 1 description with {table_name} and {column_name} placeholders]\n[step 2 description with {table_name}, {column_name}, and {value} placeholders]\n\n### Example Workflow Steps\n1. Identify the table named {table_name} which has the headers {table_headers}.\n2. Update the value in the {column_name} column to {new_value} where the {identifier_column} is equal to {identifier_value}.\n\nInsert the new airport entry with the details: {country} (Australia), {province_state} (New South Wales), {city} (Sydney), and {airport_name} (Sydney Kingsford Smith International Airport) into the table {table_name} (Airport locations by country).
