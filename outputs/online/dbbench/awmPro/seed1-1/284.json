I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

Verify the update by checking the row where Year = {year} and Competition = 'World Championships' to ensure Notes is updated to '2.40 m'.\n\nGiven that the task is to add a new row to the `MovieCredits` table, this workflow uses an SQL `INSERT INTO` statement to insert the specified details.\nINSERT INTO MovieCredits (Year, Title, Role, Notes) VALUES ({year}, {title}, {role}, {notes});\n\nGiven that the task is to update a specific row in the 'movie_production' table, this workflow updates the 'Notes' column to NULL based on the 'Title'.\n[step 1 description with {table_name} and {column_name} placeholders]\nUPDATE {table_name} SET {column_name} = NULL WHERE Title = 'Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo';\n[step 2 description with {table_name} placeholder]\nVerify the update by checking the row in the 'movie_production' table.\nSELECT * FROM {table_name} WHERE Title = 'Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo';\n\nGiven that the task is to change the year to 2003 for a specific article in the Disasters table, this workflow updates the year for the relevant entry.\n[step 1 description: Query the Disasters table to find the row where the article is related to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami]\n\\nsql\nSELECT * FROM Disasters WHERE Article = '2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami'\n\\n[step 2 description: Update the year of the found row to 2003]\n\\nsql\nUPDATE Disasters SET Year = 2003 WHERE Article = '2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami'\n\nGiven that we need to find rows with a specific opening film, this workflow filters the table to include only relevant rows.\n[step 1 description with {opening_film_name}]\n[step 2 description with {filtered_table}]\n\nGiven that the task involves updating a specific seat order in the Seat Order Table, this workflow focuses on modifying the seat order for a particular series.\n1.

Update the value in the Series 1 column for the row corresponding to the 6th position from the right to the left with the name Hilary Devey.\n\nGiven that we need to update specific tournament results in a table, this workflow updates the results for a given tournament across multiple years.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the row for the specified tournament\nIdentify the row in the \"Tournament Results by Year\" table where the `Tournament` column is equal to {tournament_name}.\n\n### Step 2: Update the results for the specified years\nUpdate the corresponding year columns with the new values: {year_values} to {updated_values}.\n\nFor example:\n- {tournament_name} = 'Australian Open'\n- {year_values} = ['2006', '2007', '2008', '2009', '2011', '2012']\n- {updated_values} = ['QF', 'SF', 'F', 'A', 'A', 'A']\n\nGiven that the task is to update the \"Tour de France Winners by Stage\" table with specific data, this workflow inserts the new data into the table.\n[step 1 description with {year}, {stage}, {start_of_stage}, {distance_km}, {category_of_climb}, {stage_winner}, {nationality}, {yellow_jersey}, {bend} placeholders]\n- Insert a new row into the \"Tour de France Winners by Stage\" table with the values: {year} = 1998, {stage} = 20, {start_of_stage} = Aix-les-Bains, {distance_km} = 149.5, {category_of_climb} = HC, {stage_winner} = Marco Pantani, {nationality} = Italy, {yellow_jersey} = Marco Pantani, {bend} = 25.\n\nExecute the SQL UPDATE statement to set the Notes column to 'Released' and the Role column to 'Todd' in the Filmography table.
