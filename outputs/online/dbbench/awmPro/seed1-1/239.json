I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

Update the columns 'Last Champions League Qualification', 'Method of Qualification', and 'Length of drought' with the values {last_qualification}, {qualification_method}, and {drought_length}, respectively.\n\nInsert the values {team1}, {agg}, {team2}, {leg1}, and {leg2} into the 'Football Match Results' table. Verify the insertion by checking if the values {team1}, {agg}, {team2}, {leg1}, and {leg2} are present in the table.\n\nGiven that the task is to update the score of a specific tie in the `Football Matches` table, this workflow performs the necessary SQL update operation.\n[step 1 description with {tie_no} and {new_score} placeholders]\nsql\nUPDATE Football_Matches\nSET Score = '{new_score}'\nWHERE Tie_no = '{tie_no}';\n\n[step 2 description with {tie_no} placeholder]\nVerify the update by selecting the row with the specified tie number.\nsql\nSELECT * FROM Football_Matches WHERE Tie_no = '{tie_no}';\n\n\nFilter the game_results table to find the score against Portland in games with numbers under 20, then extract the relevant row.\n\nGiven that the task is to find the fewest number of games played in the `football_standings` table, this workflow retrieves the minimum value from the `Games played` column.\n[step 1 description with {table_name} and {column_name} placeholders]\nsql\nSELECT MIN({column_name}) FROM {table_name};\n[step 2 description with {result_variable} placeholder]\npython\nresult = cursor.fetchone()[0]\n\nGiven that the task is to update the \"Tour de France Winners by Stage\" table with specific data, this workflow inserts the new data into the table.\n[step 1 description with {year}, {stage}, {start_of_stage}, {distance_km}, {category_of_climb}, {stage_winner}, {nationality}, {yellow_jersey}, {bend} placeholders]\n- Insert a new row into the \"Tour de France Winners by Stage\" table with the values: {year} = 1998, {stage} = 20, {start_of_stage} = Aix-les-Bains, {distance_km} = 149.5, {category_of_climb} = HC, {stage_winner} = Marco Pantani, {nationality} = Italy, {yellow_jersey} = Marco Pantani, {bend} = 25.\n\nGiven that the task is to retrieve the attendance for a specific tie number from the `Football Matches` table, this workflow involves executing a corrected SQL query.\n\nIdentify the row for the specified team: Use a SQL query to find the row where the Team column matches {team_name}. Update the specified fields: Use a SQL update statement to set the Champion and Semifinalist columns to {field1} and {field2} respectively, for the identified row.\n\nGiven that the task is to filter the number of wins for a specific club with a certain number of total final appearances, this workflow extracts the required data.\n[step 1 description with {club_name} and {appearances} placeholders]\nSELECT Wins \nFROM Scottish_Challenge_Cup_Finalists \nWHERE Club = '{club_name}' AND Total_final_appearances < {appearances}\n[step 2 description with {club_name} and {appearances} placeholders]\nSELECT COUNT(Wins) AS Total_Wins \nFROM Scottish_Challenge_Cup_Finalists \nWHERE Club = '{club_name}' AND Total_final_appearances < {appearances}\n\nUpdate the `racing_career` table by setting the `Series` to 'Formula Two', `Races` to '2', `Wins` to '1', `Podiums` to '2', `Points` to '45', and `Final Placing` to '1st' where the `Season` is equal to {season}. Verify the update by selecting the row where the `Season` is equal to {season} and check if the updated values match the provided information.\n"
