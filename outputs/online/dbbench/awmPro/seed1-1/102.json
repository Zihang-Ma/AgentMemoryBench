I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

Verify the insertion by querying the sports_venues table for the new record with Venue = {venue_name}, Sports = {sport_type}, and Capacity = {capacity}.\n\nIdentify the row in the 'Team Information' table where the 'Team' column matches the {team_name}. Update the 'Capacity' column of the identified row to the {new_capacity}.\n\nGiven that the task is to add a new row to the 'Airport Information' table, this workflow uses an SQL INSERT INTO statement to accomplish the insertion.\nINSERT INTO {table_name} (City, Country, Airport, IATA, ICAO) VALUES ('{city}', '{country}', '{airport}', '{iata}', '{icao}');\n\nInsert the new airport entry with the details: {country} (Australia), {province_state} (New South Wales), {city} (Sydney), and {airport_name} (Sydney Kingsford Smith International Airport) into the table {table_name} (Airport locations by country). Verify the insertion by checking the updated table for the new entry.\n\nGiven that the table does not exist and needs to be created, this workflow creates the Athlete Results table with the specified headers.\nCREATE TABLE Athlete_Results (\n    Year VARCHAR,\n    Competition VARCHAR,\n    Venue VARCHAR,\n    Position VARCHAR,\n    Event VARCHAR,\n    Notes VARCHAR\n);\n\n[step 2 description: Insert the new row with the provided values]\nINSERT INTO Athlete_Results (Year, Competition, Venue, Position, Event, Notes)\nVALUES ('2018', 'Lisbon Half Marathon', 'Lisbon, Portugal', '1st', 'Half marathon', '1:09:12');\n\nInsert the values {team1}, {agg}, {team2}, {leg1}, and {leg2} into the 'Football Match Results' table. Verify the insertion by checking if the values {team1}, {agg}, {team2}, {leg1}, and {leg2} are present in the table.\n\nInsert the record with the following details into the 'Library Locations' table:\\n- Branch: {branch_name}\\n- Address: {address}\\n- Neighborhood: {neighborhood}\\n- First branch opened: {first_opened}\\n- Current branch opened: {current_opened}\\nVerify the insertion by querying the 'Library Locations' table for the {branch_name} to ensure the record was added successfully.\n\nIdentify the row in the Champions League Qualification History table where the club name is {club_name}. Update the columns 'Last Champions League Qualification', 'Method of Qualification', and 'Length of drought' with the values {last_qualification}, {qualification_method}, and {drought_length}, respectively.\n\nINSERT INTO Basketball_Tournament_Stats (Tournament, Games_played, Points_per_game, Rebounds_per_game, Assists_per_game) VALUES ('2015 EuroBasket', {games_played}, {points_per_game}, {rebounds_per_game}, {assists_per_game});\\nINSERT INTO Basketball_Tournament_Stats (Tournament, Games_played, Points_per_game, Rebounds_per_game, Assists_per_game) VALUES ('2015 EuroBasket', 8, 9.1, 7.2, 1.9);\n"
