I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

Apply the condition to only update records where `Rank` is for male swimmers, `Event` is 200m backstroke, and `Nationality` is Russia.\n\nGiven that the task is to update a specific column value in a table based on a condition, this workflow updates the desired column.\n[step 1 description with {table_name} and {column_name} placeholders]\n[step 2 description with {table_name}, {column_name}, and {value} placeholders]\n\n### Example Workflow Steps\n1. Identify the table named {table_name} which has the headers {table_headers}.\n2. Update the value in the {column_name} column to {new_value} where the {identifier_column} is equal to {identifier_value}.\n\nUpdate the name in the draft_picks table where the name is 'John Smith' to 'Johnny Smith'\n\nUse the SQL UPDATE statement to modify the {column_name} column in the {table_name} table. Specify the condition for the update, which is where the {column_name} column has the value {condition}.\n\nUpdate the `Total` column to `{total_value}` in the `Nationality_Passengers_Crew_Total_Table` where the `Nationality` column equals `{nationality}`.\n\nGiven that the task involves updating a specific entry in a table, this workflow is designed to modify a value in a database table based on a given condition.\n\n[step 1] Identify the table and the specific row to update. In this case, the table is {table_name} and the row to update is identified by the {building_name}.\n\n[step 2] Update the specified column in the identified row. Here, the column to update is {column_name} and the new value is {new_value}.\n\nGiven that the task is to update a specific row in the 'movie_production' table, this workflow updates the 'Notes' column to NULL based on the 'Title'.\n[step 1 description with {table_name} and {column_name} placeholders]\nUPDATE {table_name} SET {column_name} = NULL WHERE Title = 'Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo';\n[step 2 description with {table_name} placeholder]\nVerify the update by checking the row in the 'movie_production' table.\nSELECT * FROM {table_name} WHERE Title = 'Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo';\n\nGiven that we need to update specific tournament results in a table, this workflow updates the results for a given tournament across multiple years.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the row for the specified tournament\nIdentify the row in the \"Tournament Results by Year\" table where the `Tournament` column is equal to {tournament_name}.\n\n### Step 2: Update the results for the specified years\nUpdate the corresponding year columns with the new values: {year_values} to {updated_values}.\n\nFor example:\n- {tournament_name} = 'Australian Open'\n- {year_values} = ['2006', '2007', '2008', '2009', '2011', '2012']\n- {updated_values} = ['QF', 'SF', 'F', 'A', 'A', 'A']\n\nIdentify the row in the Champions League Qualification History table where the club name is {club_name}. Update the columns 'Last Champions League Qualification', 'Method of Qualification', and 'Length of drought' with the values {last_qualification}, {qualification_method}, and {drought_length}, respectively.\n\nInform the user that the table {table_name} does not exist.
