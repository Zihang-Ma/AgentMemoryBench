I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

Apply the condition to only update records where `Rank` is for male swimmers, `Event` is 200m backstroke, and `Nationality` is Russia.\n\nGiven that the task is to update the sport of the first Olympic Flag Bearer to Basketball in the 'Olympic Flag Bearers' table, this workflow identifies and updates the specific row.\n\n[step 1] Identify the first row in the 'Olympic Flag Bearers' table by selecting the row where the `#` column equals 1.\nsql\nSELECT * FROM `Olympic Flag Bearers` WHERE `#` = 1;\n\n\n[step 2] Update the `Sport` column of the identified row to 'Basketball'.\nsql\nUPDATE `Olympic Flag Bearers` SET `Sport` = 'Basketball' WHERE `#` = 1;\n\n\nGiven that there might be multiple rows for a specific dance in the \\\"Dance Competition Results\\\" table, this workflow handles updating the \\\"Best score\\\" for all relevant rows.\n[step 1 description with {dance_name} and {table_name} placeholders]\n- Locate all rows in the {table_name} table where the \\\"Dance\\\" column is equal to {dance_name}.\n[step 2 description with {dance_name} and {new_score} placeholders]\n- Update the \\\"Best score\\\" column of all located rows for {dance_name} to {new_score}.\n\nGiven that we need to update specific tournament results in a table, this workflow updates the results for a given tournament across multiple years.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the row for the specified tournament\nIdentify the row in the \"Tournament Results by Year\" table where the `Tournament` column is equal to {tournament_name}.\n\n### Step 2: Update the results for the specified years\nUpdate the corresponding year columns with the new values: {year_values} to {updated_values}.\n\nFor example:\n- {tournament_name} = 'Australian Open'\n- {year_values} = ['2006', '2007', '2008', '2009', '2011', '2012']\n- {updated_values} = ['QF', 'SF', 'F', 'A', 'A', 'A']\n\nGiven that the task is to insert data into the 'Athlete Results' table, this workflow handles the insertion process.\n[step 1 description with {year}, {competition}, {venue}, {event}, {position}, {notes} placeholders]\nINSERT INTO Athlete_Results (Year, Competition, Venue, Position, Event, Notes) VALUES ({year}, {competition}, {venue}, {position}, {event}, {notes});\n[step 2 description with {year}, {competition}, {venue}, {event}, {position}, {notes} placeholders]\nVerify the insertion by selecting the inserted row.\nSELECT * FROM Athlete_Results WHERE Year = {year} AND Competition = {competition} AND Venue = {venue} AND Position = {position} AND Event = {event} AND Notes = {notes};\n\nGiven that we need to update the best score of a specific dance in the \\\"Dance Competition Results\\\" table, this workflow locates and updates the row(s) for the specified dance.\n[step 1 description with {dance_name} and {table_name} placeholders]\n- Locate the row(s) in the {table_name} table where the \\\"Dance\\\" column is equal to {dance_name}.\n[step 2 description with {dance_name} and {new_score} placeholders]\n- Update the \\\"Best score\\\" column of the located row(s) for {dance_name} to {new_score}.\n\nIdentify the row for the specified team: Use a SQL query to find the row where the Team column matches {team_name}. Update the specified fields: Use a SQL update statement to set the Champion and Semifinalist columns to {field1} and {field2} respectively, for the identified row.\n\nGiven that we need to insert specific data into the Horse_Racing_Champions table, this workflow inserts a new row with the provided details.\nINSERT INTO Horse_Racing_Champions (Year, Winner, Second, Third, Starters) VALUES ('{year}', '{winner}', '{second}', '{third}', '{starters}');\nGiven that we have inserted a new row into the Horse_Racing_Champions table, this workflow verifies the insertion by selecting the newly added row.\nSELECT * FROM Horse_Racing_Champions WHERE Year = '{year}';\n\nGiven that the task is to insert a record into the 'Athlete Performances' table, this workflow describes the process of inserting a new row with specific values.\n[step 1 description: Prepare the SQL insert statement with placeholders for the values]\nINSERT INTO Athlete_Performances (Year, Competition, Venue, Position, Event, Notes) VALUES ({year}, {competition}, {venue}, {position}, {event}, {notes});\n[step 2 description: Execute the SQL insert statement]\nEXECUTE the_prepared_sql_statement;\n"
