I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

Update the 'Capacity' column of the identified row to the {new_capacity}.\n\nConstruct the SQL update statement with the pick number and new club name. The statement should look like: \\nUPDATE player_recruitment SET Recruited_from = 'Geelong' WHERE Pick = 21;\\nExecute the constructed SQL update statement to modify the database.\n\nIdentify the row in the Champions League Qualification History table where the club name is {club_name}. Update the columns 'Last Champions League Qualification', 'Method of Qualification', and 'Length of drought' with the values {last_qualification}, {qualification_method}, and {drought_length}, respectively.\n\nIdentify the row for the specified team: Use a SQL query to find the row where the Team column matches {team_name}. Update the specified fields: Use a SQL update statement to set the Champion and Semifinalist columns to {field1} and {field2} respectively, for the identified row.\n\nGiven that the task is to update specific fields in the Game Statistics table, this workflow updates the high points and high rebounds for a given game. [step 1 description with {game_id} placeholder] Identify the row in the Game Statistics table where the Game column matches {game_id}. [step 2 description with {high_points} and {high_rebounds} placeholders] Update the High points and High rebounds columns in the identified row to {high_points} and {high_rebounds} respectively.\n\nGiven that we need to update the points of a specific team in the standings table, this workflow describes the process of locating and updating the row.\nSELECT * FROM standings WHERE Name = \\\"{team_name}\\\"\nUPDATE standings SET Points = \\\"{new_points}\\\" WHERE Name = \\\"{team_name}\\\"\n\nInsert a new record into the sports_venues table with the values {venue_name} for Venue, {sport_type} for Sports, and {capacity} for Capacity. Verify the insertion by querying the sports_venues table for the new record with Venue = {venue_name}, Sports = {sport_type}, and Capacity = {capacity}.\n\nGiven that we need to update specific tournament results in a table, this workflow updates the results for a given tournament across multiple years.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the row for the specified tournament\nIdentify the row in the \"Tournament Results by Year\" table where the `Tournament` column is equal to {tournament_name}.\n\n### Step 2: Update the results for the specified years\nUpdate the corresponding year columns with the new values: {year_values} to {updated_values}.\n\nFor example:\n- {tournament_name} = 'Australian Open'\n- {year_values} = ['2006', '2007', '2008', '2009', '2011', '2012']\n- {updated_values} = ['QF', 'SF', 'F', 'A', 'A', 'A']\n\nGiven that we need to find the total pick number for players in a specific position from a specific team, this workflow filters and sums the required values.\nSELECT * FROM {table_name} WHERE {query_conditions}\nSUM({column_to_sum}) AS total_pick_number\n\nGiven that the task is to update a specific record in the Footballers table, this workflow updates the position of a footballer.\n[step 1 description with {footballer_name} and {new_position} placeholders]\n[step 2 description with {table_name} and {footballer_name} placeholders]\n1. Locate the row in the {Footballers} table where the {Footballer} is {Andile Jali}.\n2. Update the {Position} column of the located row to {DF}.\n"
