Extract the player's information, including Pick, Player, Position, Nationality, and School/Club Team.\n\nGiven that we need to update specific information for a player in the \\\"Basketball Players\\\" table, this workflow performs the update operation.\n[step 1 description with \\{player_name\\} and \\{table_name\\} placeholders]\nSELECT * FROM \\{table_name\\} WHERE Player = \\'\\{player_name\\}\\';\n[step 2 description with \\{player_name\\}, \\{height\\}, and \\{current_club\\} placeholders]\nUPDATE \\{table_name\\} SET Height = \\'\\{height\\}\\', Current Club = \\'\\{current_club\\}\\' WHERE Player = \\'\\{player_name\\}\\';\n\nUpdate the NBA Playoff History table for the Los Angeles Clippers.

Update the specified fields: Use a SQL update statement to set the Champion and Semifinalist columns to {field1} and {field2} respectively, for the identified row.\n\nIdentify the row in the 'Team Information' table where the 'Team' column matches the {team_name}. Update the 'Capacity' column of the identified row to the {new_capacity}.\n\nConstruct the SQL update statement with the pick number and new club name.

Verify the update by selecting the relevant row from the basketball_coaches table where the year is {year}.\n\nINSERT INTO Basketball_Tournament_Stats (Tournament, Games_played, Points_per_game, Rebounds_per_game, Assists_per_game) VALUES ('2015 EuroBasket', {games_played}, {points_per_game}, {rebounds_per_game}, {assists_per_game});\\nINSERT INTO Basketball_Tournament_Stats (Tournament, Games_played, Points_per_game, Rebounds_per_game, Assists_per_game) VALUES ('2015 EuroBasket', 8, 9.1, 7.2, 1.9);\n"
