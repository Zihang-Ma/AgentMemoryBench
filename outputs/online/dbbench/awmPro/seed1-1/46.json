What is Round, when Winner is \"Ivanovic\", when Year is less than 2008, and when Tournament is \"Paris\"?\n\n\nHere are some useful workflows learned from past similar episodes, you can use them to help you complete the task:\nGiven that the task is to update the \"Tour de France Winners by Stage\" table with specific data, this workflow inserts the new data into the table.\n[step 1 description with {year}, {stage}, {start_of_stage}, {distance_km}, {category_of_climb}, {stage_winner}, {nationality}, {yellow_jersey}, {bend} placeholders]\n- Insert a new row into the \"Tour de France Winners by Stage\" table with the values: {year} = 1998, {stage} = 20, {start_of_stage} = Aix-les-Bains, {distance_km} = 149.5, {category_of_climb} = HC, {stage_winner} = Marco Pantani, {nationality} = Italy, {yellow_jersey} = Marco Pantani, {bend} = 25.\n\nGiven that we need to update specific tournament results in a table, this workflow updates the results for a given tournament across multiple years.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the row for the specified tournament\nIdentify the row in the \"Tournament Results by Year\" table where the `Tournament` column is equal to {tournament_name}.\n\n### Step 2: Update the results for the specified years\nUpdate the corresponding year columns with the new values: {year_values} to {updated_values}.\n\nFor example:\n- {tournament_name} = 'Australian Open'\n- {year_values} = ['2006', '2007', '2008', '2009', '2011', '2012']\n- {updated_values} = ['QF', 'SF', 'F', 'A', 'A', 'A']\n\nGiven that we need to find the result of a specific game in the `Hockey_Game_Results` table, this workflow extracts the relevant information.\n[step 1 description with {date}, {team1}, {team2} placeholders]\nsql\nSELECT * FROM Hockey_Game_Results WHERE Date = '{date}' AND (Winning Team = '{team1}' OR Winning Team = '{team2}')\n\n[step 2 description with {winning_team} placeholder]\nDetermine the {winning_team} based on the query result.\n\nINSERT INTO Basketball_Tournament_Stats (Tournament, Games_played, Points_per_game, Rebounds_per_game, Assists_per_game) VALUES ('2015 EuroBasket', {games_played}, {points_per_game}, {rebounds_per_game}, {assists_per_game});\\nINSERT INTO Basketball_Tournament_Stats (Tournament, Games_played, Points_per_game, Rebounds_per_game, Assists_per_game) VALUES ('2015 EuroBasket', 8, 9.1, 7.2, 1.9);\n\nGiven that the table does not exist and needs to be created, this workflow creates the Athlete Results table with the specified headers.\nCREATE TABLE Athlete_Results (\n    Year VARCHAR,\n    Competition VARCHAR,\n    Venue VARCHAR,\n    Position VARCHAR,\n    Event VARCHAR,\n    Notes VARCHAR\n);\n\n[step 2 description: Insert the new row with the provided values]\nINSERT INTO Athlete_Results (Year, Competition, Venue, Position, Event, Notes)\nVALUES ('2018', 'Lisbon Half Marathon', 'Lisbon, Portugal', '1st', 'Half marathon', '1:09:12');\n\nGiven that the task involves verifying the existence of a specific medal winner in the 'Medal Winners' table, this workflow checks if the record exists based on the event details.\n[step 1 description with {event}, {table}, and {date} placeholders]\nSELECT * FROM {table} WHERE Sport = 'Cross-country skiing' AND Event = '{event}' AND Medal = 'Gold' AND Date = '{date}';\n[step 2 description with {name} placeholder]\n-- If the record exists, update the name\nUPDATE {table} SET Name = '{name}' WHERE Sport = 'Cross-country skiing' AND Event = '{event}' AND Medal = 'Gold' AND Date = '{date}';\n\nGiven that the task is to update the name of a specific medal winner in the 'Medal Winners' table, this workflow updates the name based on the event details.\n[step 1 description with {event}, {name}, and {table} placeholders]\nUPDATE {table} SET Name = '{name}' WHERE Sport = 'Cross-country skiing' AND Event = '{event}' AND Medal = 'Gold';\n[step 2 description with {date} placeholder]\n-- Ensure the date is correctly formatted and check for existing records\nSELECT * FROM {table} WHERE Sport = 'Cross-country skiing' AND Event = '{event}' AND Medal = 'Gold' AND Date = '{date}';\n\nGiven that the task is to update the `Fastest Lap` column in a specific row of the `Australian Formula 3 Championship 2008 standings` table, this workflow performs the update operation.\n[step 1 description with {table_name} and {column_name} placeholders]\nsql\nUPDATE {table_name}\nSET {column_name} = 'James Winslow'\nWHERE Round = 10 AND Race = 1;\n\n[step 2 description with {table_name} placeholder]\nsql\n-- Verify the update\nSELECT * FROM {table_name} WHERE Round = 10 AND Race = 1;\n\nUpdate the 'Team' column to 'Barcelona' in the table {table_name} where the 'Position' is {position}.\\nExecute the SQL query: UPDATE {table_name} SET Team = 'Barcelona' WHERE Position = {position};\n\nGiven that we have the query result from the `Hockey_Game_Results` table, this workflow checks if a specific team won the game.\n[step 1 description with {winning_team}, {team1}, {team2} placeholders]\nCheck if the {winning_team} is either {team1} or {team2}.\n[step 2 description with {result} placeholder]\nIf {winning_team} is {team1}, then {result} is 'Dallas won the game.' If {winning_team} is {team2}, then {result} is 'Ottawa won the game.'\n"
