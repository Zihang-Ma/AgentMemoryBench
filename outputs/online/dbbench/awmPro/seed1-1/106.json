I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

Execute the constructed SQL query to update the table.\n\nInsert the new airport entry with the details: {country} (Australia), {province_state} (New South Wales), {city} (Sydney), and {airport_name} (Sydney Kingsford Smith International Airport) into the table {table_name} (Airport locations by country). Verify the insertion by checking the updated table for the new entry.\n\nIdentify the row in the table {table_name} where the Rank is equal to {rank}. Update the Lake(s) column of the identified row to {lake}.\n\nGiven that the task is to add a new row to the 'Airport Information' table, this workflow uses an SQL INSERT INTO statement to accomplish the insertion.\nINSERT INTO {table_name} (City, Country, Airport, IATA, ICAO) VALUES ('{city}', '{country}', '{airport}', '{iata}', '{icao}');\n\nGiven that the task is to update a specific row in the 'movie_production' table, this workflow updates the 'Notes' column to NULL based on the 'Title'.\n[step 1 description with {table_name} and {column_name} placeholders]\nUPDATE {table_name} SET {column_name} = NULL WHERE Title = 'Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo';\n[step 2 description with {table_name} placeholder]\nVerify the update by checking the row in the 'movie_production' table.\nSELECT * FROM {table_name} WHERE Title = 'Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo';\n\nUpdate the basketball_coaches table to set the coach to 'Bob Huggins' and the school to 'West Virginia' for the year {year}. Verify the update by selecting the relevant row from the basketball_coaches table where the year is {year}.\n\nGiven that the task involves updating a specific entry in a table, this workflow is designed to modify a value in a database table based on a given condition.\n\n[step 1] Identify the table and the specific row to update. In this case, the table is {table_name} and the row to update is identified by the {building_name}.\n\n[step 2] Update the specified column in the identified row. Here, the column to update is {column_name} and the new value is {new_value}.\n\nUpdate the name in the draft_picks table where the name is 'John Smith' to 'Johnny Smith'\n"
