To answer this, we need to:\n\n1. Identify the rows in the `Soccer Team Performance` table where the team name is \"Real Colorado Foxes\".\n2. Filter those rows to find the ones where the `Playoffs` column indicates that the team did **not qualify** (e.g., \"Did not qualify\" or \"N/A\").\n3. Ensure that the `Open Cup` column indicates that the team made it to the **2nd Round**.\n4. Among the filtered rows, find the **latest year** (i.e., the maximum year value).\n\nTo proceed, I will first query the `Soccer Team Performance` table to find all entries for \"Real Colorado Foxes\" and check their `Playoffs` and `Open Cup` status. Then, I will extract the latest year that satisfies the condition.",
