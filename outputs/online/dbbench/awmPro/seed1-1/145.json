This suggests that we need to insert a new row into the `Filmography` table with the specified details. \n\n### Solution:\nWe will use the `INSERT INTO` SQL statement to add the new row to the `Filmography` table. The values to be inserted are:\n- `Year`: 2004\n- `Title`: 'The Aviator'\n- `Role`: 'Sen. Ralph Owen Brewster'\n- `Notes`: NULL (as there are no additional notes)\n\nThe SQL query will be:\n```sql\nINSERT INTO Filmography (Year, Title, Role, Notes) VALUES (2004, 'The Aviator', 'Sen.
