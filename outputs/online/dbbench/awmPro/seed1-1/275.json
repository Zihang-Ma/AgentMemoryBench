The silver medal was won by New Zealand's Lisa Carrington and Caitlin Ryan, also finishing in 3:27.101. Poland's team consisting of Karolina Naja, Magdalena Lobnig, Maria Garbowska, and Beata Mikolajczyk took home the bronze medal, with a finishing time of 3:27.101.\n\n\nHere are some useful workflows learned from past similar episodes, you can use them to help you complete the task:\nGiven that we need to update specific medal counts for a nation in the Olympic Medal Table, this workflow updates the `Silver`, `Bronze`, and `Total` columns for a given nation.\n1. Identify the row in the `Olympic Medal Table` where `Nation` is {nation}.\n2. Update the `Silver`, `Bronze`, and `Total` columns with the values {silver}, {bronze}, and {total} respectively.\n\nGiven that the task involves verifying the existence of a specific medal winner in the 'Medal Winners' table, this workflow checks if the record exists based on the event details.\n[step 1 description with {event}, {table}, and {date} placeholders]\nSELECT * FROM {table} WHERE Sport = 'Cross-country skiing' AND Event = '{event}' AND Medal = 'Gold' AND Date = '{date}';\n[step 2 description with {name} placeholder]\n-- If the record exists, update the name\nUPDATE {table} SET Name = '{name}' WHERE Sport = 'Cross-country skiing' AND Event = '{event}' AND Medal = 'Gold' AND Date = '{date}';\n\nGiven that we need to update the `Total` column in the Olympic Medal Table, this workflow calculates the new total based on the provided silver and bronze counts.\n1. Calculate the new `Total` as the sum of {silver} and {bronze}.\n2. Update the `Total` column in the `Olympic Medal Table` for the row where `Nation` is {nation} with the calculated value.\n\nGiven that the task is to update the name of a specific medal winner in the 'Medal Winners' table, this workflow updates the name based on the event details.\n[step 1 description with {event}, {name}, and {table} placeholders]\nUPDATE {table} SET Name = '{name}' WHERE Sport = 'Cross-country skiing' AND Event = '{event}' AND Medal = 'Gold';\n[step 2 description with {date} placeholder]\n-- Ensure the date is correctly formatted and check for existing records\nSELECT * FROM {table} WHERE Sport = 'Cross-country skiing' AND Event = '{event}' AND Medal = 'Gold' AND Date = '{date}';\n\nGiven that the task is to update the \"Tour de France Winners by Stage\" table with specific data, this workflow inserts the new data into the table.\n[step 1 description with {year}, {stage}, {start_of_stage}, {distance_km}, {category_of_climb}, {stage_winner}, {nationality}, {yellow_jersey}, {bend} placeholders]\n- Insert a new row into the \"Tour de France Winners by Stage\" table with the values: {year} = 1998, {stage} = 20, {start_of_stage} = Aix-les-Bains, {distance_km} = 149.5, {category_of_climb} = HC, {stage_winner} = Marco Pantani, {nationality} = Italy, {yellow_jersey} = Marco Pantani, {bend} = 25.\n\nGiven that we need to extract the gold medal counts for specific nations from a table, this workflow extracts the required data.\n[step 1 description with {table_name} and {nation_list} placeholders]\n[step 2 description with {nation_list} and {gold_column} placeholders]\n\nGiven that the task is to update the sport of the first Olympic Flag Bearer to Basketball in the 'Olympic Flag Bearers' table, this workflow identifies and updates the specific row.\n\n[step 1] Identify the first row in the 'Olympic Flag Bearers' table by selecting the row where the `#` column equals 1.\nsql\nSELECT * FROM `Olympic Flag Bearers` WHERE `#` = 1;\n\n\n[step 2] Update the `Sport` column of the identified row to 'Basketball'.\nsql\nUPDATE `Olympic Flag Bearers` SET `Sport` = 'Basketball' WHERE `#` = 1;\n\n\nGiven that the table does not exist and needs to be created, this workflow creates the Athlete Results table with the specified headers.\nCREATE TABLE Athlete_Results (\n    Year VARCHAR,\n    Competition VARCHAR,\n    Venue VARCHAR,\n    Position VARCHAR,\n    Event VARCHAR,\n    Notes VARCHAR\n);\n\n[step 2 description: Insert the new row with the provided values]\nINSERT INTO Athlete_Results (Year, Competition, Venue, Position, Event, Notes)\nVALUES ('2018', 'Lisbon Half Marathon', 'Lisbon, Portugal', '1st', 'Half marathon', '1:09:12');\n\nGiven that we have the query result from the `Hockey_Game_Results` table, this workflow checks if a specific team won the game.\n[step 1 description with {winning_team}, {team1}, {team2} placeholders]\nCheck if the {winning_team} is either {team1} or {team2}.\n[step 2 description with {result} placeholder]\nIf {winning_team} is {team1}, then {result} is 'Dallas won the game.'
