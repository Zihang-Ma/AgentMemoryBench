I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

Identify the row in the \\\"Oil Companies Operations\\\" table where the \\\"Client\\\" is equal to {client_name}.\n2. Update the \\\"Area of Operation\\\" column of the identified row to {new_area}.\n\nGiven that the task is to insert data into the 'Athlete Results' table, this workflow handles the insertion process.\n[step 1 description with {year}, {competition}, {venue}, {event}, {position}, {notes} placeholders]\nINSERT INTO Athlete_Results (Year, Competition, Venue, Position, Event, Notes) VALUES ({year}, {competition}, {venue}, {position}, {event}, {notes});\n[step 2 description with {year}, {competition}, {venue}, {event}, {position}, {notes} placeholders]\nVerify the insertion by selecting the inserted row.\nSELECT * FROM Athlete_Results WHERE Year = {year} AND Competition = {competition} AND Venue = {venue} AND Position = {position} AND Event = {event} AND Notes = {notes};\n\nGiven that there might be multiple rows for a specific dance in the \\\"Dance Competition Results\\\" table, this workflow handles updating the \\\"Best score\\\" for all relevant rows.\n[step 1 description with {dance_name} and {table_name} placeholders]\n- Locate all rows in the {table_name} table where the \\\"Dance\\\" column is equal to {dance_name}.\n[step 2 description with {dance_name} and {new_score} placeholders]\n- Update the \\\"Best score\\\" column of all located rows for {dance_name} to {new_score}.\n\nGiven that the task is to update a specific column value in a table based on a condition, this workflow updates the desired column.\n[step 1 description with {table_name} and {column_name} placeholders]\n[step 2 description with {table_name}, {column_name}, and {value} placeholders]\n\n### Example Workflow Steps\n1. Identify the table named {table_name} which has the headers {table_headers}.\n2. Update the value in the {column_name} column to {new_value} where the {identifier_column} is equal to {identifier_value}.\n\nGiven that the task is to find the average finish for a specific position in the Racing Stats table, this workflow filters the table by the given position and calculates the average finish.\n[step 1 description: Filter the Racing Stats table by the position 70]\nSELECT Avg_Finish FROM Racing_Stats WHERE Position = 70\n[step 2 description: Calculate the average finish from the filtered results]\nSELECT AVG(Avg_Finish) FROM (SELECT Avg_Finish FROM Racing_Stats WHERE Position = 70) AS FilteredResults\n\nGiven that we need to find rows with a specific opening film, this workflow filters the table to include only relevant rows.\n[step 1 description with {opening_film_name}]\n[step 2 description with {filtered_table}]\n\nGiven that we need to extract the gold medal counts for specific nations from a table, this workflow extracts the required data.\n[step 1 description with {table_name} and {nation_list} placeholders]\n[step 2 description with {nation_list} and {gold_column} placeholders]\n\nIdentify the row with the {row_number} in the 'Papal Encyclicals Table'.
