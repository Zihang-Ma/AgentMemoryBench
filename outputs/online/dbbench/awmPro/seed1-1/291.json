Identify the row in the `Olympic Medal Table` where `Nation` is {nation}.\n2. Update the `Silver`, `Bronze`, and `Total` columns with the values {silver}, {bronze}, and {total} respectively.\n\nGiven that we need to update the `Total` column in the Olympic Medal Table, this workflow calculates the new total based on the provided silver and bronze counts.\n1. Calculate the new `Total` as the sum of {silver} and {bronze}.\n2. Update the `Total` column in the `Olympic Medal Table` for the row where `Nation` is {nation} with the calculated value.\n\nGiven that we need to extract the gold medal counts for specific nations from a table, this workflow extracts the required data.\n[step 1 description with {table_name} and {nation_list} placeholders]\n[step 2 description with {nation_list} and {gold_column} placeholders]\n\nUpdate the `Name` column to `{new_name}` in the table `{table_name}`. Apply the condition to only update records where `Rank` is for male swimmers, `Event` is 200m backstroke, and `Nationality` is Russia.\n\nGiven that the task is to update the sport of the first Olympic Flag Bearer to Basketball in the 'Olympic Flag Bearers' table, this workflow identifies and updates the specific row.\n\n[step 1] Identify the first row in the 'Olympic Flag Bearers' table by selecting the row where the `#` column equals 1.\nsql\nSELECT * FROM `Olympic Flag Bearers` WHERE `#` = 1;\n\n\n[step 2] Update the `Sport` column of the identified row to 'Basketball'.\nsql\nUPDATE `Olympic Flag Bearers` SET `Sport` = 'Basketball' WHERE `#` = 1;\n\n\nGiven that the task is to update the name of a specific medal winner in the 'Medal Winners' table, this workflow updates the name based on the event details.\n[step 1 description with {event}, {name}, and {table} placeholders]\nUPDATE {table} SET Name = '{name}' WHERE Sport = 'Cross-country skiing' AND Event = '{event}' AND Medal = 'Gold';\n[step 2 description with {date} placeholder]\n-- Ensure the date is correctly formatted and check for existing records\nSELECT * FROM {table} WHERE Sport = 'Cross-country skiing' AND Event = '{event}' AND Medal = 'Gold' AND Date = '{date}';\n\nGiven that the task is to update the \"Tour de France Winners by Stage\" table with specific data, this workflow inserts the new data into the table.\n[step 1 description with {year}, {stage}, {start_of_stage}, {distance_km}, {category_of_climb}, {stage_winner}, {nationality}, {yellow_jersey}, {bend} placeholders]\n- Insert a new row into the \"Tour de France Winners by Stage\" table with the values: {year} = 1998, {stage} = 20, {start_of_stage} = Aix-les-Bains, {distance_km} = 149.5, {category_of_climb} = HC, {stage_winner} = Marco Pantani, {nationality} = Italy, {yellow_jersey} = Marco Pantani, {bend} = 25.\n\nGiven that the task involves verifying the existence of a specific medal winner in the 'Medal Winners' table, this workflow checks if the record exists based on the event details.\n[step 1 description with {event}, {table}, and {date} placeholders]\nSELECT * FROM {table} WHERE Sport = 'Cross-country skiing' AND Event = '{event}' AND Medal = 'Gold' AND Date = '{date}';\n[step 2 description with {name} placeholder]\n-- If the record exists, update the name\nUPDATE {table} SET Name = '{name}' WHERE Sport = 'Cross-country skiing' AND Event = '{event}' AND Medal = 'Gold' AND Date = '{date}';\n\nGiven that we need to calculate the average number of gold medals for a list of nations, this workflow calculates the average.\n[step 1 description with {gold_counts} placeholder]\n[step 2 description with {average_gold_medals} placeholder]\n\nGiven that there might be multiple rows for a specific dance in the \\\"Dance Competition Results\\\" table, this workflow handles updating the \\\"Best score\\\" for all relevant rows.\n[step 1 description with {dance_name} and {table_name} placeholders]\n- Locate all rows in the {table_name} table where the \\\"Dance\\\" column is equal to {dance_name}.\n[step 2 description with {dance_name} and {new_score} placeholders]\n- Update the \\\"Best score\\\" column of all located rows for {dance_name} to {new_score}.\n"
