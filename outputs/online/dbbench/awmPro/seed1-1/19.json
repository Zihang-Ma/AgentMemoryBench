Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer.

Identify the table named {table_name} which has the headers {table_headers}.\n2. Update the value in the {column_name} column to {new_value} where the {identifier_column} is equal to {identifier_value}.\n\nGiven that the task is to update specific fields in the Game Statistics table, this workflow updates the high points and high rebounds for a given game. [step 1 description with {game_id} placeholder] Identify the row in the Game Statistics table where the Game column matches {game_id}. [step 2 description with {high_points} and {high_rebounds} placeholders] Update the High points and High rebounds columns in the identified row to {high_points} and {high_rebounds} respectively.\n\nGiven that there might be multiple rows for a specific dance in the \\\"Dance Competition Results\\\" table, this workflow handles updating the \\\"Best score\\\" for all relevant rows.\n[step 1 description with {dance_name} and {table_name} placeholders]\n- Locate all rows in the {table_name} table where the \\\"Dance\\\" column is equal to {dance_name}.\n[step 2 description with {dance_name} and {new_score} placeholders]\n- Update the \\\"Best score\\\" column of all located rows for {dance_name} to {new_score}.\n\nIdentify the row in the Champions League Qualification History table where the club name is {club_name}. Update the columns 'Last Champions League Qualification', 'Method of Qualification', and 'Length of drought' with the values {last_qualification}, {qualification_method}, and {drought_length}, respectively.\n\nGiven that the task is to find the average first elected year based on specific district and committee, this workflow filters and calculates the required average.\n[step 1 description: Extract rows where the district is 11 and the committee is environmental matters]\n\\nsql\nSELECT `First Elected` FROM Maryland_State_Legislature_Representatives WHERE `District` = 11 AND `Committee` = 'Environmental Matters'\n\\n[step 2 description: Calculate the average of the extracted `First Elected` years]\n\\nsql\nSELECT AVG(`First Elected`) FROM (SELECT `First Elected` FROM Maryland_State_Legislature_Representatives WHERE `District` = 11 AND `Committee` = 'Environmental Matters')\n\n\nGiven that the task is to add a new row to the 'Airport Information' table, this workflow uses an SQL INSERT INTO statement to accomplish the insertion.\nINSERT INTO {table_name} (City, Country, Airport, IATA, ICAO) VALUES ('{city}', '{country}', '{airport}', '{iata}', '{icao}');\n\nGiven that we need to update a specific record in the `Institutions` table, this workflow locates and updates the record based on the institution name.\n[step 1 description with {institution_name} and {new_status} placeholders]\n[step 2 description with {institution_name} and {new_status} placeholders]\n\n1. Locate the row in the `Institutions` table where the `Institution` is `{institution_name}`.\n2.
