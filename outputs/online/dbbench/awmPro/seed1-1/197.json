I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

Locate the row in the {Footballers} table where the {Footballer} is {Andile Jali}.\n2. Update the {Position} column of the located row to {DF}.\n\nGiven that we need to sum the total goals for specific players, this workflow sums the goals for the players of interest.\nSUM(`Total Goals`) FROM {player_data} WHERE `Player` = {player_names[0]}\nSUM(`Total Goals`) FROM {player_data} WHERE `Player` = {player_names[1]}\nAdd the two sums together to get the total goals for the players of interest\n\nGiven that we need to retrieve specific player data from a table, this workflow extracts the required rows for the players of interest.\nSELECT * FROM `Player Goals in International Tournaments` WHERE `Player` IN ({player_names})\nStore the result in a variable named {player_data}\n\nInsert the values {team1}, {agg}, {team2}, {leg1}, and {leg2} into the 'Football Match Results' table. Verify the insertion by checking if the values {team1}, {agg}, {team2}, {leg1}, and {leg2} are present in the table.\n\nConstruct the SQL update statement with the pick number and new club name. The statement should look like: \\nUPDATE player_recruitment SET Recruited_from = 'Geelong' WHERE Pick = 21;\\nExecute the constructed SQL update statement to modify the database.\n\nIdentify the row in the Champions League Qualification History table where the club name is {club_name}. Update the columns 'Last Champions League Qualification', 'Method of Qualification', and 'Length of drought' with the values {last_qualification}, {qualification_method}, and {drought_length}, respectively.\n\nGiven that we need to update specific tournament results in a table, this workflow updates the results for a given tournament across multiple years.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the row for the specified tournament\nIdentify the row in the \"Tournament Results by Year\" table where the `Tournament` column is equal to {tournament_name}.\n\n### Step 2: Update the results for the specified years\nUpdate the corresponding year columns with the new values: {year_values} to {updated_values}.\n\nFor example:\n- {tournament_name} = 'Australian Open'\n- {year_values} = ['2006', '2007', '2008', '2009', '2011', '2012']\n- {updated_values} = ['QF', 'SF', 'F', 'A', 'A', 'A']\n\nGiven that the task is to insert data into the 'Athlete Results' table, this workflow handles the insertion process.\n[step 1 description with {year}, {competition}, {venue}, {event}, {position}, {notes} placeholders]\nINSERT INTO Athlete_Results (Year, Competition, Venue, Position, Event, Notes) VALUES ({year}, {competition}, {venue}, {position}, {event}, {notes});\n[step 2 description with {year}, {competition}, {venue}, {event}, {position}, {notes} placeholders]\nVerify the insertion by selecting the inserted row.\nSELECT * FROM Athlete_Results WHERE Year = {year} AND Competition = {competition} AND Venue = {venue} AND Position = {position} AND Event = {event} AND Notes = {notes};\n\nUpdate the name in the draft_picks table where the name is 'John Smith' to 'Johnny Smith'\n\nGiven that we need to update the points of a specific team in the standings table, this workflow describes the process of locating and updating the row.\nSELECT * FROM standings WHERE Name = \\\"{team_name}\\\"\nUPDATE standings SET Points = \\\"{new_points}\\\" WHERE Name = \\\"{team_name}\\\"\n"
