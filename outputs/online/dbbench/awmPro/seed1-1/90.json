Update the columns 'Last Champions League Qualification', 'Method of Qualification', and 'Length of drought' with the values {last_qualification}, {qualification_method}, and {drought_length}, respectively.\n\nIdentify the row for the specified team: Use a SQL query to find the row where the Team column matches {team_name}. Update the specified fields: Use a SQL update statement to set the Champion and Semifinalist columns to {field1} and {field2} respectively, for the identified row.\n\nGiven that the task is to update a specific record in the Footballers table, this workflow updates the position of a footballer.\n[step 1 description with {footballer_name} and {new_position} placeholders]\n[step 2 description with {table_name} and {footballer_name} placeholders]\n1. Locate the row in the {Footballers} table where the {Footballer} is {Andile Jali}.\n2. Update the {Position} column of the located row to {DF}.\n\nGiven that we need to update the points of a specific team in the standings table, this workflow describes the process of locating and updating the row.\nSELECT * FROM standings WHERE Name = \\\"{team_name}\\\"\nUPDATE standings SET Points = \\\"{new_points}\\\" WHERE Name = \\\"{team_name}\\\"\n\nGiven that the task is to find the fewest number of games played in the `football_standings` table, this workflow retrieves the minimum value from the `Games played` column.\n[step 1 description with {table_name} and {column_name} placeholders]\nsql\nSELECT MIN({column_name}) FROM {table_name};\n[step 2 description with {result_variable} placeholder]\npython\nresult = cursor.fetchone()[0]\n\nConstruct the SQL update statement with the pick number and new club name. The statement should look like: \\nUPDATE player_recruitment SET Recruited_from = 'Geelong' WHERE Pick = 21;\\nExecute the constructed SQL update statement to modify the database.\n\nGiven that the task is to update specific fields in the Game Statistics table, this workflow updates the high points and high rebounds for a given game. [step 1 description with {game_id} placeholder] Identify the row in the Game Statistics table where the Game column matches {game_id}. [step 2 description with {high_points} and {high_rebounds} placeholders] Update the High points and High rebounds columns in the identified row to {high_points} and {high_rebounds} respectively.\n\nSearch for the row in the 'Irish Counties and Cities' table where the 'County or City' is {county}.\\nReturn the row details if found.\n\nInsert the values {team1}, {agg}, {team2}, {leg1}, and {leg2} into the 'Football Match Results' table. Verify the insertion by checking if the values {team1}, {agg}, {team2}, {leg1}, and {leg2} are present in the table.\n\nGiven that there might be multiple rows for a specific dance in the \\\"Dance Competition Results\\\" table, this workflow handles updating the \\\"Best score\\\" for all relevant rows.\n[step 1 description with {dance_name} and {table_name} placeholders]\n- Locate all rows in the {table_name} table where the \\\"Dance\\\" column is equal to {dance_name}.\n[step 2 description with {dance_name} and {new_score} placeholders]\n- Update the \\\"Best score\\\" column of all located rows for {dance_name} to {new_score}.\n"
