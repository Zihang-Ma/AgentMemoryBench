I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

Verify the insertion by checking the updated table for the new entry.\n\nGiven that the task is to insert a new record into the Senators table, this workflow describes the process of adding a new entry with specified details.\n[step 1 description with {senator_name}, {party}, {state}, and {religion} placeholders]\n[step 2 description with {table_name} placeholder]\n\n### Example Steps:\n1. Prepare the SQL insert statement with the values {senator_name} = 'Mitt Romney', {party} = 'Republican', {state} = 'Utah', and {religion} = 'Mormon' for the table {table_name} = 'Senators'.\n2. Execute the SQL insert statement to add the new record to the {table_name}.\n\nInsert 'Jane Smith' into the Alumni table with 'Theo' for School, 'PhD' for Degree, '2010' for Year, and 'Theology professor' for Description.\n\nIdentify the table name as {table_name}. Prepare the data to be inserted as {data}. Execute the SQL insert statement.\n\nGiven that the task is to insert specific data into a table, this workflow inserts the data into the table.\nINSERT INTO {table_name} ({column1}, {column2}, {column3}) VALUES ('{team_name}', '{value1}', '{value2}')\n\nGiven that the task is to insert a new record into the `music_catalog` table with specific values, this workflow describes how to perform the insertion.\n[step 1 description with {year}, {title}, {label}, {format} placeholders]\nINSERT INTO music_catalog (Year, Title, Label, Format) VALUES ('{year}', '{title}', '{label}', '{format}')\n[step 2 description with {year}, {title}, {label}, {format} placeholders]\nVerify the insertion by selecting the record with the given title.\nSELECT * FROM music_catalog WHERE Title = '{title}' AND Year = '{year}'\n\nGiven that column names might have special characters or formatting issues, this workflow handles such cases by ensuring the column name is correctly formatted.\n\n[step 1 description with {column_name} and {table_name} placeholders]\n- Check and correct the column name `{column_name}` in the table `{table_name}` to ensure it is correctly formatted.\n\n[step 2 description with {column_name} and {table_name} placeholders]\n- Execute the query using the corrected column name `{column_name}` in the table `{table_name}` to retrieve the required data.\n\nInsert a new record into the sports_venues table with the values {venue_name} for Venue, {sport_type} for Sports, and {capacity} for Capacity. Verify the insertion by querying the sports_venues table for the new record with Venue = {venue_name}, Sports = {sport_type}, and Capacity = {capacity}.\n"
