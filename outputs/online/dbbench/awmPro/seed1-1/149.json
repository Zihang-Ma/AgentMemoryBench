This game was part of the Football Season Results table, which also included details such as the week, game site, team record, and attendance. The team had a record of 1-1 at this point, and the attendance for this game was 21823.\n\n\nHere are some useful workflows learned from past similar episodes, you can use them to help you complete the task:\nGiven that the task involves verifying the insertion of a new row into the `baseball_game_results` table, this workflow checks if the new record is present.\n[step 1 description with {variable} placeholders]\nSELECT * FROM baseball_game_results WHERE Date = '{Date}' AND Opponent = '{Opponent}' AND Score = '{Score}' AND Loss = '{Loss}' AND Record = '{Record}'\n[step 2 description with {variable} placeholders]\n...\n\nFilter the game_results table to find the score against Portland in games with numbers under 20, then extract the relevant row.\n\nIdentify the row for the specified team: Use a SQL query to find the row where the Team column matches {team_name}. Update the specified fields: Use a SQL update statement to set the Champion and Semifinalist columns to {field1} and {field2} respectively, for the identified row.\n\nGiven that the task is to find the lowest game with a specific score, this workflow identifies the earliest game that matches the score.\n[step 1 description with {score} placeholder]\nsql\nSELECT * FROM game_score WHERE Score = {score}\n\n[step 2 description with {game_number} placeholder]\nsql\nSELECT MIN(Game) FROM (SELECT * FROM game_score WHERE Score = {score})\n\n\nSearch for the row in the 'Irish Counties and Cities' table where the 'County or City' is {county}.\\nReturn the row details if found.\n\nGiven that the task is to find the fewest number of games played in the `football_standings` table, this workflow retrieves the minimum value from the `Games played` column.\n[step 1 description with {table_name} and {column_name} placeholders]\nsql\nSELECT MIN({column_name}) FROM {table_name};\n[step 2 description with {result_variable} placeholder]\npython\nresult = cursor.fetchone()[0]\n\nInsert the values {team1}, {agg}, {team2}, {leg1}, and {leg2} into the 'Football Match Results' table. Verify the insertion by checking if the values {team1}, {agg}, {team2}, {leg1}, and {leg2} are present in the table.\n\nIdentify the row in the game_results table where the Game column equals {game_id}. Update the Team column in the identified row to {new_team}.\n\nGiven that the task is to retrieve the attendance for a specific tie number from the `Football Matches` table, this workflow involves executing a corrected SQL query.\n\nGiven that the task is to update the score of a specific tie in the `Football Matches` table, this workflow performs the necessary SQL update operation.\n[step 1 description with {tie_no} and {new_score} placeholders]\nsql\nUPDATE Football_Matches\nSET Score = '{new_score}'\nWHERE Tie_no = '{tie_no}';\n\n[step 2 description with {tie_no} placeholder]\nVerify the update by selecting the row with the specified tie number.\nsql\nSELECT * FROM Football_Matches WHERE Tie_no = '{tie_no}';\n\n"
