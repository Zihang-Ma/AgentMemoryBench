I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

Update the `Notes` column of that row to `2.40 m`.\n\nGiven that the task is to add a new record to the 'Library Locations' table, this workflow specifies the steps to insert the provided information into the table.\n[step 1 description with {branch_name}, {address}, {neighborhood}, {first_opened}, {current_opened} placeholders]\n- Insert a new row into the 'Library Locations' table with the values: {branch_name} = \\\"Oregon City Library\\\", {address} = \\\"606 John Adams Street\\\", {neighborhood} = \\\"Oregon City\\\", {first_opened} = \\\"1867\\\", {current_opened} = \\\"2021\\\".\n[step 2 description with {branch_name} placeholder]\n- Verify the insertion by checking if the new record appears in the 'Library Locations' table with the specified {branch_name}.\n\nGiven that the task is to update the elevation of a specific mountain peak in the 'Mountain Peaks' table, this workflow provides a structured approach to performing the update.\n[step 1 description with {mountain_peak} and {new_elevation} placeholders]\n\\nsql\nUPDATE `Mountain Peaks` SET `Elevation` = '{new_elevation}' WHERE `Mountain Peak` = '{mountain_peak}';\n[step 2 description with {mountain_peak} and {new_elevation} placeholders]\nVerify the update by selecting the row with the specified mountain peak.\n\\nsql\nSELECT * FROM `Mountain Peaks` WHERE `Mountain Peak` = '{mountain_peak}';\n\nLocate the first flag bearer in the table\nSELECT * FROM `Olympic Flag Bearers` WHERE `Flag bearer` = {first_flag_bearer}\nUpdate the sport of the first flag bearer to Basketball\nUPDATE `Olympic Flag Bearers` SET `Sport` = 'Basketball' WHERE `Flag bearer` = {first_flag_bearer}\n\nGiven that the task is to update a specific row in the \\\"Tour de France Winners by Stage\\\" table, this workflow updates the row with the provided data.\\n[step 1 description with {year}, {stage}, {start_of_stage}, {distance_km}, {category_of_climb}, {stage_winner}, {nationality}, {yellow_jersey}, {bend} placeholders]\\n- Update the row in the \\\"Tour de France Winners by Stage\\\" table with the following data: Year: {year}, Stage: {stage}, Start of stage: {start_of_stage}, Distance (km): {distance_km}, Category of climb: {category_of_climb}, Stage winner: {stage_winner}, Nationality: {nationality}, Yellow jersey: {yellow_jersey}, Bend: {bend}\n\nGiven that the task involves updating a specific entry in a table, this workflow describes the process of modifying a value in a database table.\n[step 1] Connect to the database containing the table 'Historic England Listed Buildings'.\n[step 2] Update the 'Year Listed' column for the row where 'Name' is 'Windsor Castle' to the value 1992.\n\nFilter the rows in {table_name} where the Manufacturer is equal to {manufacturer} and the Grid is equal to {grid_position}.
