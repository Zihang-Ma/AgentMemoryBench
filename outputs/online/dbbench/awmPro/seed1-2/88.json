Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer.

Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

Identify the row in the `Olympic Medal Table` where the `Nation` is `{nation_name}`.\n2. Update the `Bronze` column to `{bronze_count}` and increment the `Total` column by 1.\n\nFilter the 'Racing Stats' table to find the row where 'Position' = {position}. Retrieve the 'Avg. Finish' value from the filtered row.\n\nUpdate the name of specific swimmers in the swimming_men_200m_backstroke table for all male swimmers from Russia in the 200m backstroke event.\n\nUpdate the row in the NBA Playoff History table where the team is {team_name} with the following values: \n  - 'Last series win in NBA Playoffs' set to {last_series_win}\n  - 'Losing streak' set to {losing_streak}\n  - 'Series losses - teams' set to {series_loss}\nVerify the update by checking the row for {team_name} in the NBA Playoff History table to ensure the values have been correctly updated.\n\nIdentify the rows in the `Golf Champions` table where the `Player` is {player_name} and the `Finish` is {finish}. Calculate the average of the `Total` column for these rows.\n\nGiven that the task is to find the player with the highest number of titles from the Squash Players Ranking table, this workflow extracts the player with the maximum number of titles.\n[step 1 description with {table_name} and {column_name} placeholders]\n\\nsql\nSELECT Player_Name, No_of_Titles FROM {table_name} ORDER BY {column_name} DESC LIMIT 1\n\\n[step 2 description with {result_variable} placeholder]\n\\n{result_variable} = [('Jansher Khan', '8')]\n\nGiven that we need to find the smallest crowd number for a team with a specific away team score, this workflow filters the rows based on the away team score and retrieves the crowd numbers.\n\n1. Filter the rows in the `{table_name}` table where the **Away team score** is **{score}**.\n2. Retrieve the **{crowd_column}** values from the filtered rows and find the minimum (smallest) one.\n\nGiven that the task is to filter wins for a specific club with a certain number of total final appearances, this workflow extracts the required data.\n[step 1 description with {club_name} and {appearances_threshold} placeholders]\nSELECT Wins FROM Scottish_Challenge_Cup_Finalists WHERE Club = \\'{club_name}\\' AND Total_final_appearances < {appearances_threshold}\n[step 2 description with {club_name} placeholder]\nresults = execute_sql_query(query)\nwins = results[0][0]\n"
