Update the same {table_name} table by setting the {column1} to 'Notes' and the {column2} to 'Role', with the corresponding values of '{value1}' and '{value2}' respectively.\n\n1. Query the `Olympic Medals` table to find the row where the `Nation` is {nation_name}.\n2. Sum the values in the `Gold`, `Silver`, and `Bronze` columns for the row where the `Nation` is {nation_name}, or directly read the `Total` column if it exists and contains the sum.\n\nGiven that the task is to update a specific row in the \\\"Tour de France Winners by Stage\\\" table, this workflow updates the row with the provided data.\\n[step 1 description with {year}, {stage}, {start_of_stage}, {distance_km}, {category_of_climb}, {stage_winner}, {nationality}, {yellow_jersey}, {bend} placeholders]\\n- Update the row in the \\\"Tour de France Winners by Stage\\\" table with the following data: Year: {year}, Stage: {stage}, Start of stage: {start_of_stage}, Distance (km): {distance_km}, Category of climb: {category_of_climb}, Stage winner: {stage_winner}, Nationality: {nationality}, Yellow jersey: {yellow_jersey}, Bend: {bend}\n\n1. Query the `Olympic Medals` table to find any rows where the `Nation` is similar to {nation_name}.\n2. If a row is found, retrieve the value in the `Total` column for that row. If no exact match is found, use the closest match available.\n\nGiven that the task is to insert a new row into a specific table with predefined headers, this workflow inserts the data into the table.\n[step 1 description with {table_name} and {data} placeholders]\n[step 2 description with {table_name} and {data} placeholders]\n\n### Example\nsql\nINSERT INTO {table_name} ({headers})\nVALUES ({data});\n\n\n- **Step 1**: Define the table name and the headers.\n  - `{table_name}`: The name of the table, e.g., `1952_British_Grand_Prix_0`.\n  - `{headers}`: The column headers, e.g., `Pos, No, Driver, Constructor, Time, Gap`.\n\n- **Step 2**: Define the data to be inserted.\n  - `{data}`: The values to be inserted, e.g., `22, 2, 'Tony Gaze', 'HWM - Alta', '2:02', '+12'.\n\nThis workflow ensures that the data is correctly formatted and inserted into the specified table.\n\nUpdate the {table_name} table by setting the {condition_column} to 'Chaos Walking'. Update the same {table_name} table by setting the {column1} to 'Notes' to the value '{value1}' and the {column2} to 'Role' to the value '{value2}'.\n\nGiven that the table name might be incorrect, this workflow checks the correct table name using the 'information_schema'.\n[step 1 description with {table_name} placeholder]\n[step 2 description with {table_name} placeholder]\n...\nSELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = DATABASE() AND table_name LIKE '%Airport Information%';\n\nGiven that the task is to update the bronze count and total count for a specific nation in the Olympic Medal Table, this workflow identifies and updates the relevant row.\n\n### Workflow Steps\n1. Identify the row in the `Olympic Medal Table` where the `Nation` is `{nation_name}`.\n2. Update the `Bronze` column to `{bronze_count}` and increment the `Total` column by 1.\n\nGiven that the task is to set the notes to '-' for old films before 2010 in the filmography table, this workflow updates the notes column based on the film's year.\n[step 1 description with {table_name} and {year_column} placeholders]\n[step 2 description with {notes_column} placeholder]\n\n### Steps:\n1. Select rows from the {table_name} where the {year_column} is less than 2010.\n2. Update the {notes_column} to '-' for the selected rows.\n\nGiven that we need to update a specific region in a table, this workflow describes how to perform the update.\n[step 1 description with {table_name} and {region_column} placeholders]\n- Identify the row in the {table_name} where the value in the {region_column} is 'County Kildare'.\n[step 2 description with {table_name} and {region_column} placeholders]\n- Update the value in the {region_column} of the identified row to 'Midlands Region'.\n"
