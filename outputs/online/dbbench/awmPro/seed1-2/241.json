Identify the row in the `Olympic Medal Table` where the `Nation` is `{nation_name}`.\n2. Update the `Bronze` column to `{bronze_count}` and increment the `Total` column by 1.\n\n1. Query the `Olympic Medals` table to find the row where the `Nation` is {nation_name}.\n2. Sum the values in the `Gold`, `Silver`, and `Bronze` columns for the row where the `Nation` is {nation_name}, or directly read the `Total` column if it exists and contains the sum.\n\nGiven that the task is to update a specific row in the \\\"Tour de France Winners by Stage\\\" table, this workflow updates the row with the provided data.\\n[step 1 description with {year}, {stage}, {start_of_stage}, {distance_km}, {category_of_climb}, {stage_winner}, {nationality}, {yellow_jersey}, {bend} placeholders]\\n- Update the row in the \\\"Tour de France Winners by Stage\\\" table with the following data: Year: {year}, Stage: {stage}, Start of stage: {start_of_stage}, Distance (km): {distance_km}, Category of climb: {category_of_climb}, Stage winner: {stage_winner}, Nationality: {nationality}, Yellow jersey: {yellow_jersey}, Bend: {bend}\n\nGiven that we need to insert a new medalist into the `Medalists` table, this workflow inserts the details of a medalist.\n[step 1 description with {medal}, {name}, {sport}, {event} placeholders]\n\nsql\nINSERT INTO Medalists (Medal, Name, Sport, Event) VALUES ({medal}, {name}, {sport}, {event});\n\n[step 2 description with {name} placeholder]\n\nsql\nSELECT * FROM Medalists WHERE Name = {name};\n\n1. Query the `Olympic Medals` table to find any rows where the `Nation` is similar to {nation_name}.\n2. If a row is found, retrieve the value in the `Total` column for that row. If no exact match is found, use the closest match available.\n\nUpdate the name of specific swimmers in the swimming_men_200m_backstroke table for all male swimmers from Russia in the 200m backstroke event.\n\nGiven that the SQL query encounters syntax errors, this workflow describes how to handle and correct common syntax issues.\n# Enclose table name in backticks\nUPDATE `Figure Skating Competitors` SET FS = {new_fs_value} WHERE `Rank` = {rank_value};\n\n# If column name is a reserved keyword, enclose it in backticks\nUPDATE `Figure Skating Competitors` SET `FS` = {new_fs_value} WHERE `Rank` = {rank_value};\n\nIdentify the row in the \"Australian Formula 3 Championship 2008 standings\" table where the \"Round\" is {round} and the \"Race\" is {race}.\\n\\nUpdate the \"Fastest Lap\" column in the identified row to be driven by {fastest_lap_driver_name}.\n\nGiven that the task is to update the 'Points' column in a specific table based on certain conditions, this workflow ensures the correct rows are identified and updated.\n[step 1] Use an 'UPDATE' SQL statement to set the 'Points' column to 18 for rows where the 'Year' is 2010 and the 'Entrant' is 'Red Bull Racing'.\nsql\nUPDATE {table_name}\nSET Points = 18\nWHERE Year = 2010 AND Entrant = 'Red Bull Racing';\n\n[step 2] Verify the update by checking the table to ensure the 'Points' column has been correctly updated for the specified rows.\nsql\nSELECT * FROM {table_name}\nWHERE Year = 2010 AND Entrant = 'Red Bull Racing';\n\n"
