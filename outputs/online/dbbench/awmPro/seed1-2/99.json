However, the table provided, \"Climate Data,\" contains monthly data (Jan, Feb, ..., Dec) and a \"Year\" column, but it does not explicitly provide \"daily mean\" values. This suggests that the data might be stored in a different format or that the question is ambiguous.\n\nTo proceed, we need to clarify the following:\n1. What is the definition of \"daily mean\" in this context? Is it the average of the monthly values, or is it a separate column not shown in the headers?\n2. Are the monthly values (Jan, Feb, ..., Dec) representing daily means for each month?\n\nAssuming that the monthly values (Jan, Feb, ..., Dec) represent the daily mean for each month, we can calculate the average of these values to determine the yearly mean and compare it with the July value.\n\nLet's first calculate the daily mean for July and the yearly mean. We will use the `AVG` function to compute the yearly mean and then compare it with the July value. \n\nI will now execute the SQL query to calculate the yearly mean and retrieve the July value."
