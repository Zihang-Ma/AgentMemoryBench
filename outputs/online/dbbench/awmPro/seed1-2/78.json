Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer.

Based on the table `game score` with headers `Game`, `Date`, `Opponent`, `Score`, `Location`, and `Record`, we need to find the game with the score `108-85` and determine the **lowest game** (which likely refers to the earliest game in terms of chronological order or the game with the smallest `Game` identifier, depending on the context of the `Game` column).\n\nAssuming `Game` is a numeric identifier (e.g., game number), the lowest game would be the one with the smallest `Game` value. If `Game` is a date, the lowest game would be the earliest one. Since the `Score` is given as `108-85`, we will first find the row(s) with that score and then determine the lowest game based on the `Game` column.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query to find the game(s) with the score `108-85` and retrieve the `Game` value(s):",
