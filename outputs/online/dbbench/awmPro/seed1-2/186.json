Query the `Olympic Medals` table to find the row where the `Nation` is {nation_name}.\n2. Sum the values in the `Gold`, `Silver`, and `Bronze` columns for the row where the `Nation` is {nation_name}, or directly read the `Total` column if it exists and contains the sum.\n\nGiven that the task is to insert medal information into the `Olympic_Medalists` table, this workflow inserts a new record with the provided details.\n[step 1 description with {medal}, {name}, {sport}, {event}, and {date} placeholders]\n\\nsql\nINSERT INTO Olympic_Medalists (Medal, Name, Sport, Event, Date)\nVALUES ({medal}, {name}, {sport}, {event}, {date});\n\n[step 2 description with {connection} placeholder]\n\\nsql\nCOMMIT; -- To ensure the changes are saved\n\nGiven that the task is to update the bronze count and total count for a specific nation in the Olympic Medal Table, this workflow identifies and updates the relevant row.\n\n### Workflow Steps\n1.

Update the `Bronze` column to `{bronze_count}` and increment the `Total` column by 1.\n\nGiven that the task involves verifying the insertion of the medal information, this workflow checks if the new record has been correctly added to the `Olympic_Medalists` table.\n[step 1 description with {name} and {event} placeholders]\n\\nsql\nSELECT * FROM Olympic_Medalists WHERE Name = {name} AND Event = {event};\n\n[step 2 description with {expected_medal}, {expected_sport}, and {expected_date} placeholders]\n\\n-- Check if the retrieved record matches the expected values\nIF (SELECT Medal, Sport, Date FROM Olympic_Medalists WHERE Name = {name} AND Event = {event}) = ({expected_medal}, {expected_sport}, {expected_date}) THEN\n    PRINT \\\"Medal information inserted successfully.\\\";\nELSE\n    PRINT \\\"Medal information insertion failed.\\\";\nEND IF;\n\n1. Query the `Olympic Medals` table to find any rows where the `Nation` is similar to {nation_name}.\n2. If a row is found, retrieve the value in the `Total` column for that row. If no exact match is found, use the closest match available.\n\nIdentify the row in the `athlete_high_jump_records` table where the `Year` is 2009 and the `Competition` is `World Championships`. Update the `Notes` column of that row to `2.40 m`.\n\nGiven that the task is to change the venue of athlete's results for a specific event and competition, this workflow updates the venue in the `Athlete Results` table.\n[step 1 description with {year}, {competition}, {event}, {new_venue}]\n[step 2 description with {year}, {competition}, {event}, {new_venue}]\n\n### Steps\n1. Query the `Athlete Results` table to find the row where the `Year` is {year}, the `Competition` is {competition}, and the `Event` is {event}.\n2. Update the `Venue` column of the identified row to {new_venue}.\n\nGiven that the task is to add a new row to the `Athlete Results` table, this workflow inserts a new entry with specified details.\n[step 1 description: Prepare the data to be inserted with {year}, {competition}, {venue}, {position}, {event}, and {notes}]\n[step 2 description: Execute the SQL INSERT statement to add the new row into the `Athlete Results` table]\n\nGiven that we need to insert a new row into the `Athlete_results` table with specific values, this workflow performs the insertion.\n- Execute the SQL query: `INSERT INTO Athlete_results (Year, Competition, Venue, Position, Event, Notes) VALUES ('{year}', '{competition}', '{venue}', '{position}', '{event}', '{notes}')`\n- Verify the insertion by checking if the new row exists in the `Athlete_results` table.\n\nIdentify the rows in the `Golf Champions` table where the `Player` is {player_name} and the `Finish` is {finish}.
