I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

Identify the row in the `Olympic Medal Table` where the `Nation` is `{nation_name}`.\n2. Update the `Bronze` column to `{bronze_count}` and increment the `Total` column by 1.\n\nIdentify the row in the \"Australian Formula 3 Championship 2008 standings\" table where the \"Round\" is {round} and the \"Race\" is {race}.\\n\\nUpdate the \"Fastest Lap\" column in the identified row to be driven by {fastest_lap_driver_name}.\n\nUpdate the \"Fastest Lap\" column in the \"Australian Formula 3 Championship 2008 standings\" table where the \"Round\" is {round} and the \"Race\" is {race} to {fastest_lap}.\\n\\nSet the \"Fastest Lap\" column for the row with \"Round\" {round} and \"Race\" {race} to be driven by {fastest_lap_driver}.\n\nUpdate the name of specific swimmers in the swimming_men_200m_backstroke table for all male swimmers from Russia in the 200m backstroke event.\n\nUpdate the result for the {tournament_name} in the year {year} to 'QF'. Update the result for the {tournament_name} in the year {year} to 'SF'. Update the result for the {tournament_name} in the year {year} to 'F'. Update the result for the {tournament_name} in the year {year} to 'A'. Update the result for the {tournament_name} in the year {year} to 'A'. Update the result for the {tournament_name} in the year {year} to 'A'.\n\nIdentify the row in the {table_name} table where the 'Name' column matches '{team_name}'. Update the 'Points' column of the identified row to '{new_points}'.\n\nUpdate the row in the NBA Playoff History table where the team is {team_name} with the following values: \n  - 'Last series win in NBA Playoffs' set to {last_series_win}\n  - 'Losing streak' set to {losing_streak}\n  - 'Series losses - teams' set to {series_loss}\nVerify the update by checking the row for {team_name} in the NBA Playoff History table to ensure the values have been correctly updated.\n\nGiven that we need to find the smallest crowd number for a team with a specific away team score, this workflow filters the rows based on the away team score and retrieves the crowd numbers.\n\n1. Filter the rows in the `{table_name}` table where the **Away team score** is **{score}**.\n2. Retrieve the **{crowd_column}** values from the filtered rows and find the minimum (smallest) one.\n\nGiven that we need to find a game with a specific score, this workflow retrieves the game information.\n[step 1 description with {table_name} and {score} placeholders]\nSELECT Game, Date, Opponent, Score, Location, Record FROM {table_name} WHERE Score = \\'{score}\\';\n[step 2 description with {game_column} placeholder]\nDetermine the lowest game based on the {game_column} value.\nSELECT MIN({game_column}) AS lowest_game FROM (SELECT Game AS {game_column} FROM {table_name} WHERE Score = \\'{score}\\');\n\nGiven that the task is to insert data into the Schools table, this workflow describes how to perform the insertion.\ninstitution = 'Aquinas'\nlocation = 'La Crosse'\naffiliation = 'Private'\nenrollment = '312'\nmascot = 'Blugolds'\ncolors = 'Navy and gold'\nExecute SQL query: INSERT INTO Schools (Institution, Location, Affiliation, Enrollment, Mascot, Colors) VALUES (\\\"Aquinas\\\", \\\"La Crosse\\\", \\\"Private\\\", \\\"312\\\", \\\"Blugolds\\\", \\\"Navy and gold\\\")\n"
