I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

Construct the SQL `INSERT INTO` statement with the year {year}.\n2. Execute the SQL query with the title {title}, role {role}, and notes {notes}.\n\n### Example:\n1. Construct the SQL statement: `INSERT INTO Acting_Credits (Year, Title, Role, Notes) VALUES ({year}, 'The Umbrella Academy', 'Sissy', 'Main role')`.\n2. Execute the SQL query to insert the data into the table.\n\nGiven that the task is to add a new record to the `MovieCredits` table, this workflow uses the `INSERT INTO` command to insert the specified details.\n[step 1 description with {year} placeholder]\nsql\nINSERT INTO MovieCredits (Year) VALUES ({year});\n\n[step 2 description with {title}, {role}, and {notes} placeholders]\nsql\nINSERT INTO MovieCredits (Title, Role, Notes) VALUES ('{title}', '{role}', '{notes}');\n\nGiven that the SQL query encounters syntax errors, this workflow describes how to handle and correct common syntax issues.\n# Enclose table name in backticks\nUPDATE `Figure Skating Competitors` SET FS = {new_fs_value} WHERE `Rank` = {rank_value};\n\n# If column name is a reserved keyword, enclose it in backticks\nUPDATE `Figure Skating Competitors` SET `FS` = {new_fs_value} WHERE `Rank` = {rank_value};\n\nGiven that the task is to insert a new record into the `movies_roles` table with specific details, this workflow executes the SQL `INSERT` command.\n[step 1 description with {year} placeholder]\n- Set the value of `year` to '1958'.\n[step 2 description with {title} {role} {notes} placeholders]\n- Set the value of `title` to 'Vertigo', `role` to 'Judy Barton / Madeleine Elster', and `notes` to '-'.\n- Execute the SQL command `INSERT INTO movies_roles (Year,Title,Role,Notes) VALUES ({year},'{title}','{role}','{notes}')`.\n"
