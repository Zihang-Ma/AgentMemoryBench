I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

Query the `Olympic Medals` table to find the row where the `Nation` is {nation_name}.\n2. Sum the values in the `Gold`, `Silver`, and `Bronze` columns for the row where the `Nation` is {nation_name}, or directly read the `Total` column if it exists and contains the sum.\n\nGiven that the task is to update the bronze count and total count for a specific nation in the Olympic Medal Table, this workflow identifies and updates the relevant row.\n\n### Workflow Steps\n1. Identify the row in the `Olympic Medal Table` where the `Nation` is `{nation_name}`.\n2. Update the `Bronze` column to `{bronze_count}` and increment the `Total` column by 1.\n\n1. Query the `Olympic Medals` table to find any rows where the `Nation` is similar to {nation_name}.\n2. If a row is found, retrieve the value in the `Total` column for that row.
