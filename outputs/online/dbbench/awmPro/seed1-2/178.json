Update the `Notes` column of that row to `2.40 m`.\n\nGiven that the task is to change the venue of athlete's results for a specific event and competition, this workflow updates the venue in the `Athlete Results` table.\n[step 1 description with {year}, {competition}, {event}, {new_venue}]\n[step 2 description with {year}, {competition}, {event}, {new_venue}]\n\n### Steps\n1. Query the `Athlete Results` table to find the row where the `Year` is {year}, the `Competition` is {competition}, and the `Event` is {event}.\n2. Update the `Venue` column of the identified row to {new_venue}.\n\nInsert a new record into the 'Athlete Performances' table with the following values: {year} for the Year, {competition} for the Competition, {venue} for the Venue, {position} for the Position, {event} for the Event, and {notes} for the Notes. Commit the transaction to ensure the record is saved in the database.\n\nGiven that we need to insert a new row into the `Athlete_results` table with specific values, this workflow performs the insertion.\n- Execute the SQL query: `INSERT INTO Athlete_results (Year, Competition, Venue, Position, Event, Notes) VALUES ('{year}', '{competition}', '{venue}', '{position}', '{event}', '{notes}')`\n- Verify the insertion by checking if the new row exists in the `Athlete_results` table.\n\n1. Query the `Olympic Medals` table to find the row where the `Nation` is {nation_name}.\n2. Sum the values in the `Gold`, `Silver`, and `Bronze` columns for the row where the `Nation` is {nation_name}, or directly read the `Total` column if it exists and contains the sum.\n\nGiven that the task is to add a new row to the `Athlete Results` table, this workflow inserts a new entry with specified details.\n[step 1 description: Prepare the data to be inserted with {year}, {competition}, {venue}, {position}, {event}, and {notes}]\n[step 2 description: Execute the SQL INSERT statement to add the new row into the `Athlete Results` table]\n\nGiven that the task is to update a specific row in the \\\"Tour de France Winners by Stage\\\" table, this workflow updates the row with the provided data.\\n[step 1 description with {year}, {stage}, {start_of_stage}, {distance_km}, {category_of_climb}, {stage_winner}, {nationality}, {yellow_jersey}, {bend} placeholders]\\n- Update the row in the \\\"Tour de France Winners by Stage\\\" table with the following data: Year: {year}, Stage: {stage}, Start of stage: {start_of_stage}, Distance (km): {distance_km}, Category of climb: {category_of_climb}, Stage winner: {stage_winner}, Nationality: {nationality}, Yellow jersey: {yellow_jersey}, Bend: {bend}\n\nGiven that the task is to insert specific statistics into the Basketball Tournament Stats table, this workflow handles the insertion process.\n[step 1 description with {tournament}, {games_played}, {points_per_game}, {rebounds_per_game}, {assists_per_game} placeholders]\n[step 2 description with {table_name} placeholder]\n\n### Example Workflow Steps:\n1. Prepare the data to be inserted with the values: {tournament} = '2015 EuroBasket', {games_played} = 8, {points_per_game} = 9.1, {rebounds_per_game} = 7.2, {assists_per_game} = 1.9.\n2. Insert the prepared data into the {table_name} 'Basketball Tournament Stats' using an SQL insert statement.\n\n1. Query the `Olympic Medals` table to find any rows where the `Nation` is similar to {nation_name}.\n2. If a row is found, retrieve the value in the `Total` column for that row. If no exact match is found, use the closest match available.\n\nUpdate the `Position` column in the `Athletic Achievements` table based on specific criteria. Query the table to find the row where `Year` is {year}, `Competition` is {competition}, and `Event` is {event}. Update the `Position` column of the found row to {new_position}.\n"
