Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer.

Detroit's record was 7-8-2.\n\n\nHere are some useful workflows learned from past similar episodes, you can use them to help you complete the task:\nGiven that we need to find a game with a specific score, this workflow retrieves the game information.\n[step 1 description with {table_name} and {score} placeholders]\nSELECT Game, Date, Opponent, Score, Location, Record FROM {table_name} WHERE Score = \\'{score}\\';\n[step 2 description with {game_column} placeholder]\nDetermine the lowest game based on the {game_column} value.\nSELECT MIN({game_column}) AS lowest_game FROM (SELECT Game AS {game_column} FROM {table_name} WHERE Score = \\'{score}\\');\n\nGiven that the task is to insert game results into the `game_results` table, this workflow describes how to do it.\n[step 1 description with {date}, {opponent}, {score}, {loss}, {attendance}, and {record} placeholders]\n\\nsql\nINSERT INTO game_results (Date, Opponent, Score, Loss, Attendance, Record)\nVALUES ('{date}', '{opponent}', '{score}', '{loss}', '{attendance}', '{record}');\n\\n[step 2 description with {date}, {opponent}, {score}, {loss}, {attendance}, and {record} placeholders]\nVerify the insertion by checking the last inserted record in the `game_results` table.\n\\nsql\nSELECT * FROM game_results WHERE Date = '{date}' AND Opponent = '{opponent}' AND Score = '{score}' AND Loss = '{loss}' AND Attendance = '{attendance}' AND Record = '{record}';\n\nGiven that the task is to insert a new record into the baseball_game_results table, this workflow describes the process of performing the insertion.\n[step 1 description with {date}, {opponent}, {score}, {loss}, {record} placeholders]\n[step 2 description with {table_name} placeholder]\n\n### Steps:\n1. Prepare the SQL query to insert a new record into the `baseball_game_results` table with the values: `Date={date}`, `Opponent={opponent}`, `Score={score}`, `Loss={loss}`, `Record={record}`.\n2. Execute the SQL query using the appropriate database connection.\n\nGiven that the task is to filter wins for a specific club with a certain number of total final appearances, this workflow extracts the required data.\n[step 1 description with {club_name} and {appearances_threshold} placeholders]\nSELECT Wins FROM Scottish_Challenge_Cup_Finalists WHERE Club = \\'{club_name}\\' AND Total_final_appearances < {appearances_threshold}\n[step 2 description with {club_name} placeholder]\nresults = execute_sql_query(query)\nwins = results[0][0]\n\nGiven that we need to find the smallest crowd number for a team with a specific away team score, this workflow filters the rows based on the away team score and retrieves the crowd numbers.\n\n1. Filter the rows in the `{table_name}` table where the **Away team score** is **{score}**.\n2. Retrieve the **{crowd_column}** values from the filtered rows and find the minimum (smallest) one.\n\nGiven that the specific task is to find the attendance for a given tie number in the Football Matches table, this workflow is tailored to retrieve the attendance for a particular tie.\n[step 1 description with {tie_number} placeholder] Execute a SQL query to select the Attendance from the Football Matches table where Tie no = {tie_number}.\n[step 2 description with {attendance} placeholder] Store the attendance value in {attendance}.\n\nIdentify the row in the \"Australian Formula 3 Championship 2008 standings\" table where the \"Round\" is {round} and the \"Race\" is {race}.\\n\\nUpdate the \"Fastest Lap\" column in the identified row to be driven by {fastest_lap_driver_name}.\n\nLocate the row in the 'Toronto Raptors Players' table where the 'Player' is 'Kyle Lowry'. Update the 'School/Club Team' column of the located row to 'Cardinal Dougherty HS'.\n\nGiven that we need to find the minimum number of games played in the `football_standings` table, this workflow executes an SQL query to retrieve the minimum value from the `Games played` column.\n\nGiven that the task involves verifying the insertion of the medal information, this workflow checks if the new record has been correctly added to the `Olympic_Medalists` table.\n[step 1 description with {name} and {event} placeholders]\n\\nsql\nSELECT * FROM Olympic_Medalists WHERE Name = {name} AND Event = {event};\n\n[step 2 description with {expected_medal}, {expected_sport}, and {expected_date} placeholders]\n\\n-- Check if the retrieved record matches the expected values\nIF (SELECT Medal, Sport, Date FROM Olympic_Medalists WHERE Name = {name} AND Event = {event}) = ({expected_medal}, {expected_sport}, {expected_date}) THEN\n    PRINT \\\"Medal information inserted successfully.\\\";\nELSE\n    PRINT \\\"Medal information insertion failed.\\\";\nEND IF;\n"
