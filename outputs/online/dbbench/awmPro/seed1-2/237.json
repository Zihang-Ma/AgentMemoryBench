I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

Update the 'School/Club Team' column of the located row to 'Cardinal Dougherty HS'.\n\nLocate the row in the {table_name} where the {game_number} is '30'. Update the 'Opponent' column of the located row to 'New York Rangers'.\n\nGiven that the task is to insert specific statistics into the Basketball Tournament Stats table, this workflow handles the insertion process.\n[step 1 description with {tournament}, {games_played}, {points_per_game}, {rebounds_per_game}, {assists_per_game} placeholders]\n[step 2 description with {table_name} placeholder]\n\n### Example Workflow Steps:\n1. Prepare the data to be inserted with the values: {tournament} = '2015 EuroBasket', {games_played} = 8, {points_per_game} = 9.1, {rebounds_per_game} = 7.2, {assists_per_game} = 1.9.\n2. Insert the prepared data into the {table_name} 'Basketball Tournament Stats' using an SQL insert statement.\n\nIdentify the row in the 'NBA Playoff History' table where the 'Team' is {team_name}. Update the 'Last series win in NBA Playoffs' to '2020 NBA Finals', set 'Losing streak' to '0', and clear the 'Series losses - teams' field for the identified row.\n\nIdentify the row in the `athlete_high_jump_records` table where the `Year` is 2009 and the `Competition` is `World Championships`. Update the `Notes` column of that row to `2.40 m`.\n\nIdentify the row in the {table_name} table where the 'Name' column matches '{team_name}'. Update the 'Points' column of the identified row to '{new_points}'.\n\nGiven that we need to find a game with a specific score, this workflow retrieves the game information.\n[step 1 description with {table_name} and {score} placeholders]\nSELECT Game, Date, Opponent, Score, Location, Record FROM {table_name} WHERE Score = \\'{score}\\';\n[step 2 description with {game_column} placeholder]\nDetermine the lowest game based on the {game_column} value.\nSELECT MIN({game_column}) AS lowest_game FROM (SELECT Game AS {game_column} FROM {table_name} WHERE Score = \\'{score}\\');\n\nGiven that the task is to update a specific row in the \\\"Tour de France Winners by Stage\\\" table, this workflow updates the row with the provided data.\\n[step 1 description with {year}, {stage}, {start_of_stage}, {distance_km}, {category_of_climb}, {stage_winner}, {nationality}, {yellow_jersey}, {bend} placeholders]\\n- Update the row in the \\\"Tour de France Winners by Stage\\\" table with the following data: Year: {year}, Stage: {stage}, Start of stage: {start_of_stage}, Distance (km): {distance_km}, Category of climb: {category_of_climb}, Stage winner: {stage_winner}, Nationality: {nationality}, Yellow jersey: {yellow_jersey}, Bend: {bend}\n\nUpdate the `Height` column for the row where `Player` is equal to {player_name} with the value {new_height}. Update the `Current Club` column for the row where `Player` is equal to {player_name} with the value {new_club}.\n"
