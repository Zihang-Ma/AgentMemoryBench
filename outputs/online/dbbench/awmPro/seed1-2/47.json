I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

Prepare the data to be inserted with the values: {tournament} = '2015 EuroBasket', {games_played} = 8, {points_per_game} = 9.1, {rebounds_per_game} = 7.2, {assists_per_game} = 1.9.\n2. Insert the prepared data into the {table_name} 'Basketball Tournament Stats' using an SQL insert statement.\n\nIdentify the row in the \"Australian Formula 3 Championship 2008 standings\" table where the \"Round\" is {round} and the \"Race\" is {race}.\\n\\nUpdate the \"Fastest Lap\" column in the identified row to be driven by {fastest_lap_driver_name}.\n\nGiven that the task is to find the leagues that the New York men's soccer team has played in, excluding the National Premier Soccer League (NPSL), this workflow filters the leagues based on the provided table.\nSELECT DISTINCT `League` FROM `Soccer Team Performance Table` WHERE `League` != 'NPSL' AND `Regular Season` LIKE '%New York%'\n\n\nUpdate the row in the NBA Playoff History table where the team is {team_name} with the following values: \n  - 'Last series win in NBA Playoffs' set to {last_series_win}\n  - 'Losing streak' set to {losing_streak}\n  - 'Series losses - teams' set to {series_loss}\nVerify the update by checking the row for {team_name} in the NBA Playoff History table to ensure the values have been correctly updated.\n\nGiven that the task is to change the venue of athlete's results for a specific event and competition, this workflow updates the venue in the `Athlete Results` table.\n[step 1 description with {year}, {competition}, {event}, {new_venue}]\n[step 2 description with {year}, {competition}, {event}, {new_venue}]\n\n### Steps\n1. Query the `Athlete Results` table to find the row where the `Year` is {year}, the `Competition` is {competition}, and the `Event` is {event}.\n2. Update the `Venue` column of the identified row to {new_venue}.\n\nGiven that we need to find the smallest crowd number for a team with a specific away team score, this workflow filters the rows based on the away team score and retrieves the crowd numbers.\n\n1. Filter the rows in the `{table_name}` table where the **Away team score** is **{score}**.\n2. Retrieve the **{crowd_column}** values from the filtered rows and find the minimum (smallest) one.\n\nGiven that the task is to insert game results into the `game_results` table, this workflow describes how to do it.\n[step 1 description with {date}, {opponent}, {score}, {loss}, {attendance}, and {record} placeholders]\n\\nsql\nINSERT INTO game_results (Date, Opponent, Score, Loss, Attendance, Record)\nVALUES ('{date}', '{opponent}', '{score}', '{loss}', '{attendance}', '{record}');\n\\n[step 2 description with {date}, {opponent}, {score}, {loss}, {attendance}, and {record} placeholders]\nVerify the insertion by checking the last inserted record in the `game_results` table.\n\\nsql\nSELECT * FROM game_results WHERE Date = '{date}' AND Opponent = '{opponent}' AND Score = '{score}' AND Loss = '{loss}' AND Attendance = '{attendance}' AND Record = '{record}';\n\nLocate the row in the 'Toronto Raptors Players' table where the 'Player' is 'Kyle Lowry'. Update the 'School/Club Team' column of the located row to 'Cardinal Dougherty HS'.\n"
