However, the table headers are `Games`, `Gold`, `Silver`, and `Bronze`, which suggest that the table is designed to store the total number of medals won by a nation in a specific game, not individual medalists. Therefore, the provided workflows for inserting into `Olympic_Medalists` are not applicable here.\n\nTo proceed, I will assume that the `Olympic Medals by Game` table is intended to store the total number of medals (Gold, Silver, Bronze) for a specific game. Since the question does not provide the exact number of medals for each individual, I will insert a placeholder row for the 1990 Tokyo Olympic games with the names of the medalists as part of the data. However, this is not a standard approach for the given table structure, and the question might be missing some details.\n\nI will now execute the SQL query to insert the data for the 1990 Tokyo Olympic games with the names of the medalists.
