I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

Filter the rows in the `{table_name}` table where the **Away team score** is **{score}**.\n2. Retrieve the **{crowd_column}** values from the filtered rows and find the minimum (smallest) one.\n\nGiven that the task is to insert a new record into the baseball_game_results table, this workflow describes the process of performing the insertion.\n[step 1 description with {date}, {opponent}, {score}, {loss}, {record} placeholders]\n[step 2 description with {table_name} placeholder]\n\n### Steps:\n1. Prepare the SQL query to insert a new record into the `baseball_game_results` table with the values: `Date={date}`, `Opponent={opponent}`, `Score={score}`, `Loss={loss}`, `Record={record}`.\n2. Execute the SQL query using the appropriate database connection.\n\nGiven that the task is to set the notes to '-' for old films before 2010 in the filmography table, this workflow updates the notes column based on the film's year.\n[step 1 description with {table_name} and {year_column} placeholders]\n[step 2 description with {notes_column} placeholder]\n\n### Steps:\n1.
