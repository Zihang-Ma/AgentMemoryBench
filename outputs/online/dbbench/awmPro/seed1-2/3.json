However, the table provided is named \"Football Matches\" and contains the following headers: Tie no, Home team, Score, Away team, Date. This table does not explicitly provide the scores of individual teams (e.g., Southampton's score or Sunderland's score) in a structured way. Instead, it only provides the \"Score\" column, which likely represents the combined score of the match (e.g., \"2-1\").\n\nTo answer the question, we need to find matches where either Southampton or Sunderland is involved and extract their scores. Then, we can calculate the difference between the two scores. \n\nLet's proceed with the following steps:\n1. Find all matches involving Southampton and extract their scores.\n2. Find all matches involving Sunderland and extract their scores.\n3. Calculate the difference between the scores of Southampton and Sunderland.\n\nI will start by retrieving all matches involving Southampton."
