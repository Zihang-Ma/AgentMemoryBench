I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer.

Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

Execute the SQL insert statement with the values '2019', 'Joker', 'Arthur Fleck/Joker', and 'Academy Award winning performance for Best Actor' respectively.\n\nGiven that we need to add a new record to the `Acting Credits` table with specific details, this workflow inserts the data into the table.\n[step 1 description with {year} placeholder]\n[step 2 description with {title} {role} {notes} placeholders]\n\n### Steps:\n1. Construct the SQL `INSERT INTO` statement with the year {year}.\n2. Execute the SQL query with the title {title}, role {role}, and notes {notes}.\n\n### Example:\n1. Construct the SQL statement: `INSERT INTO Acting_Credits (Year, Title, Role, Notes) VALUES ({year}, 'The Umbrella Academy', 'Sissy', 'Main role')`.\n2.
