I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

Filter the rows in the `{table_name}` table where the **Away team score** is **{score}**.\n2. Retrieve the **{crowd_column}** values from the filtered rows and find the minimum (smallest) one.\n\nGiven that the task is to insert game results into the `game_results` table, this workflow describes how to do it.\n[step 1 description with {date}, {opponent}, {score}, {loss}, {attendance}, and {record} placeholders]\n\\nsql\nINSERT INTO game_results (Date, Opponent, Score, Loss, Attendance, Record)\nVALUES ('{date}', '{opponent}', '{score}', '{loss}', '{attendance}', '{record}');\n\\n[step 2 description with {date}, {opponent}, {score}, {loss}, {attendance}, and {record} placeholders]\nVerify the insertion by checking the last inserted record in the `game_results` table.\n\\nsql\nSELECT * FROM game_results WHERE Date = '{date}' AND Opponent = '{opponent}' AND Score = '{score}' AND Loss = '{loss}' AND Attendance = '{attendance}' AND Record = '{record}';\n\nGiven that the task is to find the leagues that the New York men's soccer team has played in, excluding the National Premier Soccer League (NPSL), this workflow filters the leagues based on the provided table.\nSELECT DISTINCT `League` FROM `Soccer Team Performance Table` WHERE `League` != 'NPSL' AND `Regular Season` LIKE '%New York%'\n\n\nGiven that we need to update the transfer fee for a specific player in the \\\"Football Team Transfers\\\" table, this workflow performs the necessary SQL update.\n[step 1 description with \\{variable\\} placeholders]\n\\nsql\nUPDATE Football_Team_Transfers\nSET Transfer_fee = \\'{new_transfer_fee}\\'\nWHERE Name = \\'{player_name}\\';\n\n[step 2 description with \\{variable\\} placeholders]\nVerify the update by selecting the row with the updated transfer fee.\n\\nsql\nSELECT * FROM Football_Team_Transfers\nWHERE Name = \\'{player_name}\\';\n\nGiven that we need to find the association with the latest joining year, this workflow extracts the maximum joining year from the \\\"Football Teams\\\" table.\n[step 1 description with {table_name} and {column_name} placeholders]\nSELECT {association}, MAX({joining_year}) FROM {table_name} GROUP BY {association}\n[step 2 description with {variable} placeholders]\nSELECT {association} FROM {table_name} WHERE {joining_year} = {max_joining_year}\n"
