I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

Update the 'Last series win in NBA Playoffs' to '2020 NBA Finals', set 'Losing streak' to '0', and clear the 'Series losses - teams' field for the identified row.\n\nGiven that we need to find the score for a specific team in games with numbers under a certain threshold, this workflow extracts the required score from the `game_results` table.\n[step 1 description with {game_number_threshold} and {team_name} placeholders]\nSELECT Score FROM game_results WHERE Game < {game_number_threshold} AND Team = \\'{team_name}\\'\n[step 2 description with {result_variable} placeholder]\n{result_variable} = execute_query_and_fetch_one_score()\n\nGiven that the task is to update a specific score in the Football Matches table, this workflow sets the score for a given tie number.\n[step 1 description with {tie_no} and {new_score} placeholders]\n[step 2 description with {table_name} placeholder]\n\n### Steps:\n1. Identify the row in the {table_name} where the {tie_no} is 1.\n2. Update the \"Score\" column of the identified row to {new_score}.\n\nFilter the Player_Stats table to find rows where sacks is 11.5 and then find the minimum interception yards from the filtered results\n\nGiven that the context is to find the \"Last of whiteness\" for specific products in a table, this workflow retrieves the required values.\n1. Query the {table_name} table to find the \"Length of use\" and \"Last of whiteness\" for the products {product_names}.\n2. Extract the \"Last of whiteness\" values for the specified products from the query results.\n\nGiven that the task is to insert game results into the `game_results` table, this workflow describes how to do it.\n[step 1 description with {date}, {opponent}, {score}, {loss}, {attendance}, and {record} placeholders]\n\\nsql\nINSERT INTO game_results (Date, Opponent, Score, Loss, Attendance, Record)\nVALUES ('{date}', '{opponent}', '{score}', '{loss}', '{attendance}', '{record}');\n\\n[step 2 description with {date}, {opponent}, {score}, {loss}, {attendance}, and {record} placeholders]\nVerify the insertion by checking the last inserted record in the `game_results` table.\n\\nsql\nSELECT * FROM game_results WHERE Date = '{date}' AND Opponent = '{opponent}' AND Score = '{score}' AND Loss = '{loss}' AND Attendance = '{attendance}' AND Record = '{record}';\n\nGiven that we need to find the smallest crowd number for a team with a specific away team score, this workflow filters the rows based on the away team score and retrieves the crowd numbers.\n\n1. Filter the rows in the `{table_name}` table where the **Away team score** is **{score}**.\n2. Retrieve the **{crowd_column}** values from the filtered rows and find the minimum (smallest) one.\n\nGiven that the task is to filter wins for a specific club with a certain number of total final appearances, this workflow extracts the required data.\n[step 1 description with {club_name} and {appearances_threshold} placeholders]\nSELECT Wins FROM Scottish_Challenge_Cup_Finalists WHERE Club = \\'{club_name}\\' AND Total_final_appearances < {appearances_threshold}\n[step 2 description with {club_name} placeholder]\nresults = execute_sql_query(query)\nwins = results[0][0]\n\nGiven that we need to find a game with a specific score, this workflow retrieves the game information.\n[step 1 description with {table_name} and {score} placeholders]\nSELECT Game, Date, Opponent, Score, Location, Record FROM {table_name} WHERE Score = \\'{score}\\';\n[step 2 description with {game_column} placeholder]\nDetermine the lowest game based on the {game_column} value.\nSELECT MIN({game_column}) AS lowest_game FROM (SELECT Game AS {game_column} FROM {table_name} WHERE Score = \\'{score}\\');\n"
