I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

Commit the transaction to ensure the record is saved in the database.\n\nGiven that the task is to insert medal information into the `Olympic_Medalists` table, this workflow inserts a new record with the provided details.\n[step 1 description with {medal}, {name}, {sport}, {event}, and {date} placeholders]\n\\nsql\nINSERT INTO Olympic_Medalists (Medal, Name, Sport, Event, Date)\nVALUES ({medal}, {name}, {sport}, {event}, {date});\n\n[step 2 description with {connection} placeholder]\n\\nsql\nCOMMIT; -- To ensure the changes are saved\n\nGiven that the task is to change the venue of athlete's results for a specific event and competition, this workflow updates the venue in the `Athlete Results` table.\n[step 1 description with {year}, {competition}, {event}, {new_venue}]\n[step 2 description with {year}, {competition}, {event}, {new_venue}]\n\n### Steps\n1. Query the `Athlete Results` table to find the row where the `Year` is {year}, the `Competition` is {competition}, and the `Event` is {event}.\n2. Update the `Venue` column of the identified row to {new_venue}.\n\nGiven that we need to insert a new medalist into the `Medalists` table, this workflow inserts the details of a medalist.\n[step 1 description with {medal}, {name}, {sport}, {event} placeholders]\n\nsql\nINSERT INTO Medalists (Medal, Name, Sport, Event) VALUES ({medal}, {name}, {sport}, {event});\n\n[step 2 description with {name} placeholder]\n\nsql\nSELECT * FROM Medalists WHERE Name = {name};\n\nGiven that the task is to add a new row to the `Athlete Results` table, this workflow inserts a new entry with specified details.\n[step 1 description: Prepare the data to be inserted with {year}, {competition}, {venue}, {position}, {event}, and {notes}]\n[step 2 description: Execute the SQL INSERT statement to add the new row into the `Athlete Results` table]\n\nIdentify the row in the `athlete_high_jump_records` table where the `Year` is 2009 and the `Competition` is `World Championships`. Update the `Notes` column of that row to `2.40 m`.\n\nGiven that the task involves verifying the insertion of the medal information, this workflow checks if the new record has been correctly added to the `Olympic_Medalists` table.\n[step 1 description with {name} and {event} placeholders]\n\\nsql\nSELECT * FROM Olympic_Medalists WHERE Name = {name} AND Event = {event};\n\n[step 2 description with {expected_medal}, {expected_sport}, and {expected_date} placeholders]\n\\n-- Check if the retrieved record matches the expected values\nIF (SELECT Medal, Sport, Date FROM Olympic_Medalists WHERE Name = {name} AND Event = {event}) = ({expected_medal}, {expected_sport}, {expected_date}) THEN\n    PRINT \\\"Medal information inserted successfully.\\\";\nELSE\n    PRINT \\\"Medal information insertion failed.\\\";\nEND IF;\n\nGiven that the task is to insert specific statistics into the Basketball Tournament Stats table, this workflow handles the insertion process.\n[step 1 description with {tournament}, {games_played}, {points_per_game}, {rebounds_per_game}, {assists_per_game} placeholders]\n[step 2 description with {table_name} placeholder]\n\n### Example Workflow Steps:\n1. Prepare the data to be inserted with the values: {tournament} = '2015 EuroBasket', {games_played} = 8, {points_per_game} = 9.1, {rebounds_per_game} = 7.2, {assists_per_game} = 1.9.\n2. Insert the prepared data into the {table_name} 'Basketball Tournament Stats' using an SQL insert statement.\n\n1. Query the `Olympic Medals` table to find the row where the `Nation` is {nation_name}.\n2. Sum the values in the `Gold`, `Silver`, and `Bronze` columns for the row where the `Nation` is {nation_name}, or directly read the `Total` column if it exists and contains the sum.\n"
