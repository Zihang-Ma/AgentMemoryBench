I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

Select rows from the {table_name} where the {year_column} is less than 2010.\n2. Update the {notes_column} to '-' for the selected rows.\n\nGiven that the task is to update the bronze count and total count for a specific nation in the Olympic Medal Table, this workflow identifies and updates the relevant row.\n\n### Workflow Steps\n1. Identify the row in the `Olympic Medal Table` where the `Nation` is `{nation_name}`.\n2. Update the `Bronze` column to `{bronze_count}` and increment the `Total` column by 1.\n\nGiven that the task is to find the player with the highest number of titles from the Squash Players Ranking table, this workflow extracts the player with the maximum number of titles.\n[step 1 description with {table_name} and {column_name} placeholders]\n\\nsql\nSELECT Player_Name, No_of_Titles FROM {table_name} ORDER BY {column_name} DESC LIMIT 1\n\\n[step 2 description with {result_variable} placeholder]\n\\n{result_variable} = [('Jansher Khan', '8')]\n\nUpdate the \"Fastest Lap\" column in the \"Australian Formula 3 Championship 2008 standings\" table where the \"Round\" is {round} and the \"Race\" is {race} to {fastest_lap}.\\n\\nSet the \"Fastest Lap\" column for the row with \"Round\" {round} and \"Race\" {race} to be driven by {fastest_lap_driver}.\n\nGiven that the task involves specifying the exact details to be inserted into the `MovieCredits` table, this workflow ensures the correct data is added.\n{year} = 2017\n{title} = 'Wonder Woman'\n{role} = 'Diana Prince/Wonder Woman'\n{notes} = '-'\n\nFilter the rows in the AFL Cairns Grand Final Results table where the Year column matches the {year}. Check if the {team} appears in the Premiers column of the filtered rows. If it does, return the team name; otherwise, return None.\n\nGiven that the task is to insert data into the Movie_Credits table, this workflow describes the process of inserting a new record.\n[step 1 description with {year}, {title}, {role}, and {notes} placeholders]\n[step 2 description with {year}, {title}, {role}, and {notes} placeholders]\n\n### Steps:\n1. Prepare the SQL insert statement with the placeholders {year}, {title}, {role}, and {notes} to insert a new record into the Movie_Credits table.\n2. Execute the SQL insert statement with the values '2019', 'Joker', 'Arthur Fleck/Joker', and 'Academy Award winning performance for Best Actor' respectively.\n\nGiven that we need to find the association with the latest joining year, this workflow extracts the maximum joining year from the \\\"Football Teams\\\" table.\n[step 1 description with {table_name} and {column_name} placeholders]\nSELECT {association}, MAX({joining_year}) FROM {table_name} GROUP BY {association}\n[step 2 description with {variable} placeholders]\nSELECT {association} FROM {table_name} WHERE {joining_year} = {max_joining_year}\n"
