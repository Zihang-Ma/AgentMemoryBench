Query the `Olympic Medals` table to find the row where the `Nation` is {nation_name}.\n2.

Update the `Bronze` column to `{bronze_count}` and increment the `Total` column by 1.\n\nUpdate the name of specific swimmers in the swimming_men_200m_backstroke table for all male swimmers from Russia in the 200m backstroke event.\n\nGiven that we need to find the number of nations that won no silver medals at all in the `Olympic Medal Table`, this workflow filters the table based on the `Silver` column.\nSELECT COUNT(*) FROM Olympic_Medal_Table WHERE Silver = 0\n\n1.
