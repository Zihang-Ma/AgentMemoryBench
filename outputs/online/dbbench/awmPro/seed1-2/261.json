Identify the row in the `Olympic Medal Table` where the `Nation` is `{nation_name}`.\n2. Update the `Bronze` column to `{bronze_count}` and increment the `Total` column by 1.\n\nGiven that the task is to insert medal information into the `Olympic_Medalists` table, this workflow inserts a new record with the provided details.\n[step 1 description with {medal}, {name}, {sport}, {event}, and {date} placeholders]\n\\nsql\nINSERT INTO Olympic_Medalists (Medal, Name, Sport, Event, Date)\nVALUES ({medal}, {name}, {sport}, {event}, {date});\n\n[step 2 description with {connection} placeholder]\n\\nsql\nCOMMIT; -- To ensure the changes are saved\n\nUpdate the name of specific swimmers in the swimming_men_200m_backstroke table for all male swimmers from Russia in the 200m backstroke event.\n\nGiven that the task involves verifying the insertion of the medal information, this workflow checks if the new record has been correctly added to the `Olympic_Medalists` table.\n[step 1 description with {name} and {event} placeholders]\n\\nsql\nSELECT * FROM Olympic_Medalists WHERE Name = {name} AND Event = {event};\n\n[step 2 description with {expected_medal}, {expected_sport}, and {expected_date} placeholders]\n\\n-- Check if the retrieved record matches the expected values\nIF (SELECT Medal, Sport, Date FROM Olympic_Medalists WHERE Name = {name} AND Event = {event}) = ({expected_medal}, {expected_sport}, {expected_date}) THEN\n    PRINT \\\"Medal information inserted successfully.\\\";\nELSE\n    PRINT \\\"Medal information insertion failed.\\\";\nEND IF;\n\nUpdate the \"Fastest Lap\" column in the \"Australian Formula 3 Championship 2008 standings\" table where the \"Round\" is {round} and the \"Race\" is {race} to {fastest_lap}.\\n\\nSet the \"Fastest Lap\" column for the row with \"Round\" {round} and \"Race\" {race} to be driven by {fastest_lap_driver}.\n\nLocate the first flag bearer in the table\nSELECT * FROM `Olympic Flag Bearers` WHERE `Flag bearer` = {first_flag_bearer}\nUpdate the sport of the first flag bearer to Basketball\nUPDATE `Olympic Flag Bearers` SET `Sport` = 'Basketball' WHERE `Flag bearer` = {first_flag_bearer}\n\nIdentify the row in the \"Australian Formula 3 Championship 2008 standings\" table where the \"Round\" is {round} and the \"Race\" is {race}.\\n\\nUpdate the \"Fastest Lap\" column in the identified row to be driven by {fastest_lap_driver_name}.\n\nUpdate the `Position` column in the `Athletic Achievements` table based on specific criteria. Query the table to find the row where `Year` is {year}, `Competition` is {competition}, and `Event` is {event}. Update the `Position` column of the found row to {new_position}.\n\nGiven that the task is to change the venue of athlete's results for a specific event and competition, this workflow updates the venue in the `Athlete Results` table.\n[step 1 description with {year}, {competition}, {event}, {new_venue}]\n[step 2 description with {year}, {competition}, {event}, {new_venue}]\n\n### Steps\n1. Query the `Athlete Results` table to find the row where the `Year` is {year}, the `Competition` is {competition}, and the `Event` is {event}.\n2. Update the `Venue` column of the identified row to {new_venue}.\n\nGiven that the task is to update the year of a specific award in the Awards table, this workflow updates the year for a given recipient and award.\n[step 1 description with {recipient} and {award_year} placeholders]\n- Update the `Year` column to {award_year} where `Recipient` is {recipient} and `Award` is 'ARIA Music Awards' in the `Awards` table.\n[step 2 description with {recipient} placeholder]\n- Verify the update by checking if the `Year` for {recipient} in the `Awards` table is now 2010.\n"
