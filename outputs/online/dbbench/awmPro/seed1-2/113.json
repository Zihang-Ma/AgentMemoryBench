I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

Prepare the data to be inserted with the values: {tournament} = '2015 EuroBasket', {games_played} = 8, {points_per_game} = 9.1, {rebounds_per_game} = 7.2, {assists_per_game} = 1.9.\n2. Insert the prepared data into the {table_name} 'Basketball Tournament Stats' using an SQL insert statement.\n\n1. Query the `Olympic Medals` table to find the row where the `Nation` is {nation_name}.\n2. Sum the values in the `Gold`, `Silver`, and `Bronze` columns for the row where the `Nation` is {nation_name}, or directly read the `Total` column if it exists and contains the sum.\n\nGiven that the task is to insert data into the Schools table, this workflow describes how to perform the insertion.\ninstitution = 'Aquinas'\nlocation = 'La Crosse'\naffiliation = 'Private'\nenrollment = '312'\nmascot = 'Blugolds'\ncolors = 'Navy and gold'\nExecute SQL query: INSERT INTO Schools (Institution, Location, Affiliation, Enrollment, Mascot, Colors) VALUES (\\\"Aquinas\\\", \\\"La Crosse\\\", \\\"Private\\\", \\\"312\\\", \\\"Blugolds\\\", \\\"Navy and gold\\\")\n\nGiven that the task is to update the bronze count and total count for a specific nation in the Olympic Medal Table, this workflow identifies and updates the relevant row.\n\n### Workflow Steps\n1. Identify the row in the `Olympic Medal Table` where the `Nation` is `{nation_name}`.\n2. Update the `Bronze` column to `{bronze_count}` and increment the `Total` column by 1.\n\nGiven that the task is to find the crude death rate for a specific number of deaths, this workflow extracts the crude death rate from the 'Population Dynamics Table.'\n[step 1: Check if the 'Population Dynamics Table' exists in the database.]\n[step 2: Query the table for the row where the 'Deaths' value is {deaths_value} and retrieve the corresponding 'Crude Death Rate.']\n\nGiven that the task involves updating a specific row in a database table, this workflow verifies the correctness of the update.\n[step 1 description with {table_name} and {nationality} placeholders]\nSELECT * FROM {table_name} WHERE Nationality = \\'{nationality}';\n[step 2 description with {expected_total} placeholder]\n-- Check if the Total column for the specified Nationality is set to {expected_total}\n\nGiven that the 'Population Dynamics Table' exists and the row for the specified number of deaths is found, this workflow extracts the crude death rate.\n[step 1: Use a SQL query to find the row where 'Deaths' = {deaths_value}.\n[step 2: Extract the 'Crude Death Rate' from the result.]\n\nInsert a new row into the 'Airport locations by country' table with the values {country}, {province_state}, {city}, and {airport_name} into the columns Country, Province / State, City, and Airport respectively.
