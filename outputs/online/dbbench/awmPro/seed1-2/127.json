The achievement has been recorded in the Athletic Achievements database with the relevant information.\n\n\nHere are some useful workflows learned from past similar episodes, you can use them to help you complete the task:\nIdentify the row in the `athlete_high_jump_records` table where the `Year` is 2009 and the `Competition` is `World Championships`. Update the `Notes` column of that row to `2.40 m`.\n\nUpdate the `Position` column in the `Athletic Achievements` table based on specific criteria. Query the table to find the row where `Year` is {year}, `Competition` is {competition}, and `Event` is {event}. Update the `Position` column of the found row to {new_position}.\n\nGiven that the task is to change the venue of athlete's results for a specific event and competition, this workflow updates the venue in the `Athlete Results` table.\n[step 1 description with {year}, {competition}, {event}, {new_venue}]\n[step 2 description with {year}, {competition}, {event}, {new_venue}]\n\n### Steps\n1. Query the `Athlete Results` table to find the row where the `Year` is {year}, the `Competition` is {competition}, and the `Event` is {event}.\n2. Update the `Venue` column of the identified row to {new_venue}.\n\nInsert a new record into the 'Athlete Performances' table with the following values: {year} for the Year, {competition} for the Competition, {venue} for the Venue, {position} for the Position, {event} for the Event, and {notes} for the Notes. Commit the transaction to ensure the record is saved in the database.\n\nGiven that the task is to insert medal information into the `Olympic_Medalists` table, this workflow inserts a new record with the provided details.\n[step 1 description with {medal}, {name}, {sport}, {event}, and {date} placeholders]\n\\nsql\nINSERT INTO Olympic_Medalists (Medal, Name, Sport, Event, Date)\nVALUES ({medal}, {name}, {sport}, {event}, {date});\n\n[step 2 description with {connection} placeholder]\n\\nsql\nCOMMIT; -- To ensure the changes are saved\n\nGiven that the task involves verifying the insertion of the medal information, this workflow checks if the new record has been correctly added to the `Olympic_Medalists` table.\n[step 1 description with {name} and {event} placeholders]\n\\nsql\nSELECT * FROM Olympic_Medalists WHERE Name = {name} AND Event = {event};\n\n[step 2 description with {expected_medal}, {expected_sport}, and {expected_date} placeholders]\n\\n-- Check if the retrieved record matches the expected values\nIF (SELECT Medal, Sport, Date FROM Olympic_Medalists WHERE Name = {name} AND Event = {event}) = ({expected_medal}, {expected_sport}, {expected_date}) THEN\n    PRINT \\\"Medal information inserted successfully.\\\";\nELSE\n    PRINT \\\"Medal information insertion failed.\\\";\nEND IF;\n\nGiven that the task is to update the bronze count and total count for a specific nation in the Olympic Medal Table, this workflow identifies and updates the relevant row.\n\n### Workflow Steps\n1. Identify the row in the `Olympic Medal Table` where the `Nation` is `{nation_name}`.\n2. Update the `Bronze` column to `{bronze_count}` and increment the `Total` column by 1.\n\nGiven that we need to insert a new row into the `Athlete_results` table with specific values, this workflow performs the insertion.\n- Execute the SQL query: `INSERT INTO Athlete_results (Year, Competition, Venue, Position, Event, Notes) VALUES ('{year}', '{competition}', '{venue}', '{position}', '{event}', '{notes}')`\n- Verify the insertion by checking if the new row exists in the `Athlete_results` table.\n\nGiven that the task is to add a new row to the `Athlete Results` table, this workflow inserts a new entry with specified details.\n[step 1 description: Prepare the data to be inserted with {year}, {competition}, {venue}, {position}, {event}, and {notes}]\n[step 2 description: Execute the SQL INSERT statement to add the new row into the `Athlete Results` table]\n\nGiven that the task is to insert specific statistics into the Basketball Tournament Stats table, this workflow handles the insertion process.\n[step 1 description with {tournament}, {games_played}, {points_per_game}, {rebounds_per_game}, {assists_per_game} placeholders]\n[step 2 description with {table_name} placeholder]\n\n### Example Workflow Steps:\n1. Prepare the data to be inserted with the values: {tournament} = '2015 EuroBasket', {games_played} = 8, {points_per_game} = 9.1, {rebounds_per_game} = 7.2, {assists_per_game} = 1.9.\n2.
