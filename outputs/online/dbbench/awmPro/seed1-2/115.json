I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

The team suffered a loss, with Cotton having a record of 3-3. The game had an attendance of 30,000, bringing the team's overall record to 30-27. The game results were inserted into the database using the following values: Date='June 2', Opponent='Red Sox', Score='3 - 2', Loss='Cotton (3-3)', Attendance='30,000', and Record='30-27'.\n\n\nHere are some useful workflows learned from past similar episodes, you can use them to help you complete the task:\nGiven that the task is to insert a new record into the baseball_game_results table, this workflow describes the process of performing the insertion.\n[step 1 description with {date}, {opponent}, {score}, {loss}, {record} placeholders]\n[step 2 description with {table_name} placeholder]\n\n### Steps:\n1. Prepare the SQL query to insert a new record into the `baseball_game_results` table with the values: `Date={date}`, `Opponent={opponent}`, `Score={score}`, `Loss={loss}`, `Record={record}`.\n2. Execute the SQL query using the appropriate database connection.\n\nGiven that we need to find a game with a specific score, this workflow retrieves the game information.\n[step 1 description with {table_name} and {score} placeholders]\nSELECT Game, Date, Opponent, Score, Location, Record FROM {table_name} WHERE Score = \\'{score}\\';\n[step 2 description with {game_column} placeholder]\nDetermine the lowest game based on the {game_column} value.\nSELECT MIN({game_column}) AS lowest_game FROM (SELECT Game AS {game_column} FROM {table_name} WHERE Score = \\'{score}\\');\n\nGiven that the task is to filter wins for a specific club with a certain number of total final appearances, this workflow extracts the required data.\n[step 1 description with {club_name} and {appearances_threshold} placeholders]\nSELECT Wins FROM Scottish_Challenge_Cup_Finalists WHERE Club = \\'{club_name}\\' AND Total_final_appearances < {appearances_threshold}\n[step 2 description with {club_name} placeholder]\nresults = execute_sql_query(query)\nwins = results[0][0]\n\nGiven that the specific task is to find the attendance for a given tie number in the Football Matches table, this workflow is tailored to retrieve the attendance for a particular tie.\n[step 1 description with {tie_number} placeholder] Execute a SQL query to select the Attendance from the Football Matches table where Tie no = {tie_number}.\n[step 2 description with {attendance} placeholder] Store the attendance value in {attendance}.\n\nGiven that the task involves verifying the insertion of the medal information, this workflow checks if the new record has been correctly added to the `Olympic_Medalists` table.\n[step 1 description with {name} and {event} placeholders]\n\\nsql\nSELECT * FROM Olympic_Medalists WHERE Name = {name} AND Event = {event};\n\n[step 2 description with {expected_medal}, {expected_sport}, and {expected_date} placeholders]\n\\n-- Check if the retrieved record matches the expected values\nIF (SELECT Medal, Sport, Date FROM Olympic_Medalists WHERE Name = {name} AND Event = {event}) = ({expected_medal}, {expected_sport}, {expected_date}) THEN\n    PRINT \\\"Medal information inserted successfully.\\\";\nELSE\n    PRINT \\\"Medal information insertion failed.\\\";\nEND IF;\n\nGiven that we need to find the smallest crowd number for a team with a specific away team score, this workflow filters the rows based on the away team score and retrieves the crowd numbers.\n\n1.

Retrieve the **{crowd_column}** values from the filtered rows and find the minimum (smallest) one.\n\nGiven that we need to find the minimum number of games played in the `football_standings` table, this workflow executes an SQL query to retrieve the minimum value from the `Games played` column.\n\nGiven that the task is to find the player with the highest number of titles from the Squash Players Ranking table, this workflow extracts the player with the maximum number of titles.\n[step 1 description with {table_name} and {column_name} placeholders]\n\\nsql\nSELECT Player_Name, No_of_Titles FROM {table_name} ORDER BY {column_name} DESC LIMIT 1\n\\n[step 2 description with {result_variable} placeholder]\n\\n{result_variable} = [('Jansher Khan', '8')]\n\nGiven that the task is to insert data into the Schools table, this workflow describes how to perform the insertion.\ninstitution = 'Aquinas'\nlocation = 'La Crosse'\naffiliation = 'Private'\nenrollment = '312'\nmascot = 'Blugolds'\ncolors = 'Navy and gold'\nExecute SQL query: INSERT INTO Schools (Institution, Location, Affiliation, Enrollment, Mascot, Colors) VALUES (\\\"Aquinas\\\", \\\"La Crosse\\\", \\\"Private\\\", \\\"312\\\", \\\"Blugolds\\\", \\\"Navy and gold\\\")\n\nGiven that we need to find the association with the latest joining year, this workflow extracts the maximum joining year from the \\\"Football Teams\\\" table.\n[step 1 description with {table_name} and {column_name} placeholders]\nSELECT {association}, MAX({joining_year}) FROM {table_name} GROUP BY {association}\n[step 2 description with {variable} placeholders]\nSELECT {association} FROM {table_name} WHERE {joining_year} = {max_joining_year}\n"
