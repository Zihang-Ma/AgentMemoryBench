I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

Identify the row in the `Olympic Medal Table` where the `Nation` is `{nation_name}`.\n2. Update the `Bronze` column to `{bronze_count}` and increment the `Total` column by 1.\n\nGiven that the task is to find the player with the highest number of titles from the Squash Players Ranking table, this workflow extracts the player with the maximum number of titles.\n[step 1 description with {table_name} and {column_name} placeholders]\n\\nsql\nSELECT Player_Name, No_of_Titles FROM {table_name} ORDER BY {column_name} DESC LIMIT 1\n\\n[step 2 description with {result_variable} placeholder]\n\\n{result_variable} = [('Jansher Khan', '8')]\n\nGiven that the task is to insert medal information into the `Olympic_Medalists` table, this workflow inserts a new record with the provided details.\n[step 1 description with {medal}, {name}, {sport}, {event}, and {date} placeholders]\n\\nsql\nINSERT INTO Olympic_Medalists (Medal, Name, Sport, Event, Date)\nVALUES ({medal}, {name}, {sport}, {event}, {date});\n\n[step 2 description with {connection} placeholder]\n\\nsql\nCOMMIT; -- To ensure the changes are saved\n\nGiven that the task is to update a specific player's 'Runs' attribute in the 'CricketPlayers' table, this workflow performs the necessary database update.\n[step 1 description with {player_name} and {runs_value} placeholders]\n[step 2 description with {table_name} placeholder]\n\n### Steps:\n1. Use a SQL query to update the 'Runs' attribute to {runs_value} for the player with the name {player_name} in the {table_name} table.\n2. Execute the SQL query to update the database.\n\nFind the row in the `Seat Order Table` where the seat position is {position} from the right to the left. Set the value in the `{series}` column of the identified row to {name}.\n\nGiven that the task involves verifying the insertion of the medal information, this workflow checks if the new record has been correctly added to the `Olympic_Medalists` table.\n[step 1 description with {name} and {event} placeholders]\n\\nsql\nSELECT * FROM Olympic_Medalists WHERE Name = {name} AND Event = {event};\n\n[step 2 description with {expected_medal}, {expected_sport}, and {expected_date} placeholders]\n\\n-- Check if the retrieved record matches the expected values\nIF (SELECT Medal, Sport, Date FROM Olympic_Medalists WHERE Name = {name} AND Event = {event}) = ({expected_medal}, {expected_sport}, {expected_date}) THEN\n    PRINT \\\"Medal information inserted successfully.\\\";\nELSE\n    PRINT \\\"Medal information insertion failed.\\\";\nEND IF;\n\nUpdate the record where Notes are set to '-' and change the Year, Title, Role, and Notes to new values\n\nUPDATE Actress_Filmography\nSET Year = '2008', Title = 'Sorority House Massacre 2', Role = 'Hannah', Notes = 'Video'\nWHERE Notes = '-';\n\nVerify the update by selecting the updated row\n\nSELECT * FROM Actress_Filmography WHERE Year = '2008' AND Title = 'Sorority House Massacre 2' AND Role = 'Hannah' AND Notes = 'Video';\n\nGiven that the task is to modify the capacity of a specific team in the 'Team Information' table, this workflow updates the capacity for a given team.\n[step 1 description with {team_name} and {new_capacity} placeholders]\n[step 2 description with {table_name} placeholder]\n\n### Steps:\n1. Identify the row in the 'Team Information' table where the 'Team' column matches the {team_name}.\n2. Update the 'Capacity' column of the identified row to the {new_capacity}.\n\nUpdate the 'Pos' and 'Name' columns where the 'No' column matches a specific value, where {table_name} is the name of the table and {no_value} is the value to match\n\nUPDATE {table_name} SET Pos = 'FW', Name = 'Yuji Senuma' WHERE No = '{no_value}';\n\nVerify the update by selecting the updated row, where {table_name} is the name of the table and {no_value} is the value to match\n\nSELECT * FROM {table_name} WHERE No = '{no_value}';\n\nIdentify the row in the `Seat Order Table` where the seat position is {position} from the right to the left.
