I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

The team lost with a score of 2-4, bringing their record to 4-5-1. The location of the game is also being recorded.\n\n\nHere are some useful workflows learned from past similar episodes, you can use them to help you complete the task:\nGiven that we need to find a game with a specific score, this workflow retrieves the game information.\n[step 1 description with {table_name} and {score} placeholders]\nSELECT Game, Date, Opponent, Score, Location, Record FROM {table_name} WHERE Score = \\'{score}\\';\n[step 2 description with {game_column} placeholder]\nDetermine the lowest game based on the {game_column} value.\nSELECT MIN({game_column}) AS lowest_game FROM (SELECT Game AS {game_column} FROM {table_name} WHERE Score = \\'{score}\\');\n\nGiven that the task is to modify the capacity of a specific team in the 'Team Information' table, this workflow updates the capacity for a given team.\n[step 1 description with {team_name} and {new_capacity} placeholders]\n[step 2 description with {table_name} placeholder]\n\n### Steps:\n1. Identify the row in the 'Team Information' table where the 'Team' column matches the {team_name}.\n2. Update the 'Capacity' column of the identified row to the {new_capacity}.\n\nGiven that we need to find the smallest crowd number for a team with a specific away team score, this workflow filters the rows based on the away team score and retrieves the crowd numbers.\n\n1. Filter the rows in the `{table_name}` table where the **Away team score** is **{score}**.\n2. Retrieve the **{crowd_column}** values from the filtered rows and find the minimum (smallest) one.\n\nGiven that the task is to update the bronze count and total count for a specific nation in the Olympic Medal Table, this workflow identifies and updates the relevant row.\n\n### Workflow Steps\n1. Identify the row in the `Olympic Medal Table` where the `Nation` is `{nation_name}`.\n2. Update the `Bronze` column to `{bronze_count}` and increment the `Total` column by 1.\n\nPrepare the SQL insert statement with the values for {team}, {city}, {arena}, and {address}:\nINSERT INTO {table_name} (Team, City, Arena, Address) VALUES ('{team}', '{city}', '{arena}', '{address}');\nExecute the SQL insert statement to add the new record to the {table_name}:\n\nGiven that we need to find the minimum number of games played in the `football_standings` table, this workflow executes an SQL query to retrieve the minimum value from the `Games played` column.\n\nGiven that the task is to update a specific player's 'Runs' attribute in the 'CricketPlayers' table, this workflow performs the necessary database update.\n[step 1 description with {player_name} and {runs_value} placeholders]\n[step 2 description with {table_name} placeholder]\n\n### Steps:\n1. Use a SQL query to update the 'Runs' attribute to {runs_value} for the player with the name {player_name} in the {table_name} table.\n2. Execute the SQL query to update the database.\n\nGiven that the task is to insert medal information into the `Olympic_Medalists` table, this workflow inserts a new record with the provided details.\n[step 1 description with {medal}, {name}, {sport}, {event}, and {date} placeholders]\n\\nsql\nINSERT INTO Olympic_Medalists (Medal, Name, Sport, Event, Date)\nVALUES ({medal}, {name}, {sport}, {event}, {date});\n\n[step 2 description with {connection} placeholder]\n\\nsql\nCOMMIT; -- To ensure the changes are saved\n\nGiven that the task involves verifying the insertion of the medal information, this workflow checks if the new record has been correctly added to the `Olympic_Medalists` table.\n[step 1 description with {name} and {event} placeholders]\n\\nsql\nSELECT * FROM Olympic_Medalists WHERE Name = {name} AND Event = {event};\n\n[step 2 description with {expected_medal}, {expected_sport}, and {expected_date} placeholders]\n\\n-- Check if the retrieved record matches the expected values\nIF (SELECT Medal, Sport, Date FROM Olympic_Medalists WHERE Name = {name} AND Event = {event}) = ({expected_medal}, {expected_sport}, {expected_date}) THEN\n    PRINT \\\"Medal information inserted successfully.\\\";\nELSE\n    PRINT \\\"Medal information insertion failed.\\\";\nEND IF;\n\nGiven that the task is to insert a new coach into the `Coaches` table, this workflow uses an `INSERT` query to add the specified coach details.\n[step 1 description with {coach_name}, {coach_class}, {coach_position}, {coach_team} placeholders]\n\\nsql\nINSERT INTO Coaches (Name, Class, Position, Team) \nVALUES ('{coach_name}', '{coach_class}', '{coach_position}', '{coach_team}');\n[step 2 description with {tool_call} placeholder]\n\\nsql\nexecute_sql(query=step_1_query)\n"
