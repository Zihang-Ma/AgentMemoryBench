I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

Filter the rows in the `{table_name}` table where the **Away team score** is **{score}**.\n2. Retrieve the **{crowd_column}** values from the filtered rows and find the minimum (smallest) one.\n\nGiven that the task is to modify the capacity of a specific team in the 'Team Information' table, this workflow updates the capacity for a given team.\n[step 1 description with {team_name} and {new_capacity} placeholders]\n[step 2 description with {table_name} placeholder]\n\n### Steps:\n1. Identify the row in the 'Team Information' table where the 'Team' column matches the {team_name}.\n2. Update the 'Capacity' column of the identified row to the {new_capacity}.\n\nGiven that we need to find the association with the latest joining year, this workflow extracts the maximum joining year from the \\\"Football Teams\\\" table.\n[step 1 description with {table_name} and {column_name} placeholders]\nSELECT {association}, MAX({joining_year}) FROM {table_name} GROUP BY {association}\n[step 2 description with {variable} placeholders]\nSELECT {association} FROM {table_name} WHERE {joining_year} = {max_joining_year}\n\nGiven that the task is to find the player with the highest number of titles from the Squash Players Ranking table, this workflow extracts the player with the maximum number of titles.\n[step 1 description with {table_name} and {column_name} placeholders]\n\\nsql\nSELECT Player_Name, No_of_Titles FROM {table_name} ORDER BY {column_name} DESC LIMIT 1\n\\n[step 2 description with {result_variable} placeholder]\n\\n{result_variable} = [('Jansher Khan', '8')]\n\nGiven that we need to update the transfer fee for a specific player in the \\\"Football Team Transfers\\\" table, this workflow performs the necessary SQL update.\n[step 1 description with \\{variable\\} placeholders]\n\\nsql\nUPDATE Football_Team_Transfers\nSET Transfer_fee = \\'{new_transfer_fee}\\'\nWHERE Name = \\'{player_name}\\';\n\n[step 2 description with \\{variable\\} placeholders]\nVerify the update by selecting the row with the updated transfer fee.\n\\nsql\nSELECT * FROM Football_Team_Transfers\nWHERE Name = \\'{player_name}\\';\n\nGiven that the task is to filter wins for a specific club with a certain number of total final appearances, this workflow extracts the required data.\n[step 1 description with {club_name} and {appearances_threshold} placeholders]\nSELECT Wins FROM Scottish_Challenge_Cup_Finalists WHERE Club = \\'{club_name}\\' AND Total_final_appearances < {appearances_threshold}\n[step 2 description with {club_name} placeholder]\nresults = execute_sql_query(query)\nwins = results[0][0]\n\nGiven that we need to find a game with a specific score, this workflow retrieves the game information.\n[step 1 description with {table_name} and {score} placeholders]\nSELECT Game, Date, Opponent, Score, Location, Record FROM {table_name} WHERE Score = \\'{score}\\';\n[step 2 description with {game_column} placeholder]\nDetermine the lowest game based on the {game_column} value.\nSELECT MIN({game_column}) AS lowest_game FROM (SELECT Game AS {game_column} FROM {table_name} WHERE Score = \\'{score}\\');\n\nGiven that we need to find the minimum number of games played in the `football_standings` table, this workflow executes an SQL query to retrieve the minimum value from the `Games played` column.\n\nGiven that the task is to insert a new coach into the `Coaches` table, this workflow uses an `INSERT` query to add the specified coach details.\n[step 1 description with {coach_name}, {coach_class}, {coach_position}, {coach_team} placeholders]\n\\nsql\nINSERT INTO Coaches (Name, Class, Position, Team) \nVALUES ('{coach_name}', '{coach_class}', '{coach_position}', '{coach_team}');\n[step 2 description with {tool_call} placeholder]\n\\nsql\nexecute_sql(query=step_1_query)\n\nGiven that the task is to update the bronze count and total count for a specific nation in the Olympic Medal Table, this workflow identifies and updates the relevant row.\n\n### Workflow Steps\n1. Identify the row in the `Olympic Medal Table` where the `Nation` is `{nation_name}`.\n2. Update the `Bronze` column to `{bronze_count}` and increment the `Total` column by 1.\n"
