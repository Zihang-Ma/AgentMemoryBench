      "content": "The question is asking for the most goals scored by players during two specific time periods: 1972–1975 and 1976–1982. To answer this, we need to:\n\n1. **Understand the table structure**: The table `football_player_statistics` contains the following columns: `Name`, `Position`, `Period`, `Appearances¹`, `Goals¹`, and `Nationality²`. The `Period` column likely contains the time frame during which the player's statistics were recorded.\n\n2. **Filter the data**: We need to extract the rows where the `Period` falls within the specified ranges: 1972–1975 and 1976–1982.\n\n3. **Find the maximum goals**: For each time period, we will find the player with the highest number of goals in the `Goals¹` column.\n\n4. **Return the results**: The final answer will be the player(s) with the most goals for each of the two time periods.\n\nI will now execute the first SQL query to find the player with the most goals for the time period 1972–1975.",
