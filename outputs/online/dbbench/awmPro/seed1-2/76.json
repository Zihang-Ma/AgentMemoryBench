I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

Update the 'School/Club Team' column of the located row to 'Cardinal Dougherty HS'.\n\nLocate the first flag bearer in the table\nSELECT * FROM `Olympic Flag Bearers` WHERE `Flag bearer` = {first_flag_bearer}\nUpdate the sport of the first flag bearer to Basketball\nUPDATE `Olympic Flag Bearers` SET `Sport` = 'Basketball' WHERE `Flag bearer` = {first_flag_bearer}\n\nIdentify the row in the \"Australian Formula 3 Championship 2008 standings\" table where the \"Round\" is {round} and the \"Race\" is {race}.\\n\\nUpdate the \"Fastest Lap\" column in the identified row to be driven by {fastest_lap_driver_name}.\n\nUpdate the row in the NBA Playoff History table where the team is {team_name} with the following values: \n  - 'Last series win in NBA Playoffs' set to {last_series_win}\n  - 'Losing streak' set to {losing_streak}\n  - 'Series losses - teams' set to {series_loss}\nVerify the update by checking the row for {team_name} in the NBA Playoff History table to ensure the values have been correctly updated.\n\nGiven that the task is to insert specific statistics into the Basketball Tournament Stats table, this workflow handles the insertion process.\n[step 1 description with {tournament}, {games_played}, {points_per_game}, {rebounds_per_game}, {assists_per_game} placeholders]\n[step 2 description with {table_name} placeholder]\n\n### Example Workflow Steps:\n1. Prepare the data to be inserted with the values: {tournament} = '2015 EuroBasket', {games_played} = 8, {points_per_game} = 9.1, {rebounds_per_game} = 7.2, {assists_per_game} = 1.9.\n2. Insert the prepared data into the {table_name} 'Basketball Tournament Stats' using an SQL insert statement.\n\nGiven that the task is to find the player with the highest number of titles from the Squash Players Ranking table, this workflow extracts the player with the maximum number of titles.\n[step 1 description with {table_name} and {column_name} placeholders]\n\\nsql\nSELECT Player_Name, No_of_Titles FROM {table_name} ORDER BY {column_name} DESC LIMIT 1\n\\n[step 2 description with {result_variable} placeholder]\n\\n{result_variable} = [('Jansher Khan', '8')]\n\nUpdate the `Height` column for the row where `Player` is equal to {player_name} with the value {new_height}. Update the `Current Club` column for the row where `Player` is equal to {player_name} with the value {new_club}.\n\nGiven that we need to find a game with a specific score, this workflow retrieves the game information.\n[step 1 description with {table_name} and {score} placeholders]\nSELECT Game, Date, Opponent, Score, Location, Record FROM {table_name} WHERE Score = \\'{score}\\';\n[step 2 description with {game_column} placeholder]\nDetermine the lowest game based on the {game_column} value.\nSELECT MIN({game_column}) AS lowest_game FROM (SELECT Game AS {game_column} FROM {table_name} WHERE Score = \\'{score}\\');\n\nUpdate the name of specific swimmers in the swimming_men_200m_backstroke table for all male swimmers from Russia in the 200m backstroke event.\n\nIdentify the row in the table {table_name} where the Position is {position}.
