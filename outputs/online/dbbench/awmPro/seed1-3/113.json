I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

Verify the update by checking the row in the `{table_name}` table.\n\nGiven that the task is to insert specific values into the venue_table, this workflow handles the insertion process.\n[step 1 description with {table_name} and {column_names} placeholders]: Connect to the database where the table {table_name} is located.\n[step 2 description with {values} placeholder]: Execute the SQL insert statement with values {values} into the columns {column_names} of the table {table_name}.\n\nGiven that the task is to insert data into the 'Athlete Results' table, this workflow specifies the steps to perform the insertion.\nINSERT INTO Athlete_Results (Year, Competition, Venue, Position, Event, Notes) VALUES ({year}, {competition}, {venue}, {position}, {event}, {notes});\nA confirmation message is returned indicating the success or failure of the insertion.\n\nSelect rows from the table `raiders_game_stats` where the value in the `Game` column is equal to {game_number}. Count the distinct values in the `Raiders first downs` column from the filtered rows.\n\nGiven that the task is to find the score against Portland in games under 20, this workflow filters the `game_results` table based on the game number and team.\n[step 1 description with {game_number} and {team} placeholders]\nSELECT * FROM game_results WHERE Game < {game_number} AND Team = \\'{team}\\'\n[step 2 description with {score_column} placeholder]\nSELECT {score_column} FROM game_results WHERE Game < {game_number} AND Team = \\'{team}\\'\n\nGiven that the task is to change the state of a specific record in the Monogram_Town_State table, this workflow updates the state based on a given condition.
