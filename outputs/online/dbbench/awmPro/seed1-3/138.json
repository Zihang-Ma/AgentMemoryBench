The team lost with a score of 2-4, bringing their record to 4-5-1. The location of the game is also being recorded.\n\n\nHere are some useful workflows learned from past similar episodes, you can use them to help you complete the task:\nUpdate the row in the NBA Playoff History table where the team is {team_name} to set the 'Last series win in NBA Playoffs' to {last_series_win}, 'Losing streak' to {losing_streak}, and 'Series losses - teams' to {series_losses_teams}. Verify the update by checking the row for {team_name} in the NBA Playoff History table to ensure the fields have been updated correctly.\n\nGiven that the task is to find the score against Portland in games under 20, this workflow filters the `game_results` table based on the game number and team.\n[step 1 description with {game_number} and {team} placeholders]\nSELECT * FROM game_results WHERE Game < {game_number} AND Team = \\'{team}\\'\n[step 2 description with {score_column} placeholder]\nSELECT {score_column} FROM game_results WHERE Game < {game_number} AND Team = \\'{team}\\'\n\nQuery the standings table to find the row where the Name is {team_name}. Update the Points column of the found row to {new_points}.\n\nLocate the row with the specified position\\n\\nsql\\nSELECT * FROM table_14876228_1 WHERE Position = \\'{position}\\'\\n\\n\\nUpdate the team name for the specified position\\n\\nsql\\nUPDATE table_14876228_1 SET Team = 'Barcelona' WHERE Position = \\'{position}\\'\\n\n\nGiven that we need to find the Attendance for a specific Round and Home team in the Hockey Games table, this workflow constructs and executes an SQL query.\n\nQuery the standings table to check if the row with Name = {team_name} exists. If the row exists, proceed with the update; otherwise, return an error message indicating the team does not exist.\n\nGiven that we need to update the `Champions League Qualification History` table with specific information for a club, this workflow updates the relevant fields for the club in question.\nSELECT club_name FROM Champions_League_Qualification_History WHERE club_name = 'FC Cincinnati';\nUPDATE Champions_League_Qualification_History\nSET last_champions_league_qualification = '{last_qualification_date}',\n    method_of_qualification = '{qualification_method}',\n    length_of_drought = '{drought_length}'\nWHERE club_name = '{club_name};'\n\nGiven that the task is to modify the capacity of a specific team in the 'Team Information' table, this workflow updates the capacity for a given team.\n\n[step 1 description with {team_name} and {new_capacity} placeholders]\n[step 2 description with {table_name} placeholder]\n\n1. Identify the row in the 'Team Information' table where the 'Team' column matches '{team_name}'.\n2. Update the 'Capacity' column of the identified row to '{new_capacity}'.\n\nGiven that the task is to update the total points of a specific competitor in the 'Figure Skating Competitors' table, this workflow updates the `Total Points` for a given `Rank`.\n\n[step 1 description with {variable} placeholders]\n- Identify the row in the 'Figure Skating Competitors' table where the `Rank` is {rank}.\n\n[step 2 description with {variable} placeholders]\n- Update the `Total Points` column of the identified row to {new_total_points}.\n\nGiven that we need to update specific information for a player in the `Basketball Players` table, this workflow performs the update operation.\n[step 1 description with {player_name} and {new_height} placeholders]\nUPDATE Basketball_Players\nSET Height = \\'{new_height}\\'\nWHERE Player = \\'{player_name}\\';\n[step 2 description with {new_club} placeholder]\nUPDATE Basketball_Players\nSET Current_Club = \\'{new_club}\\'\nWHERE Player = \\'{player_name}\\';\n"
