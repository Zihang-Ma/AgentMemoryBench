I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

Based on the table headers provided (Crude Death Rate), it seems that the \"crude rate\" refers to the \"Crude Death Rate\" column. However, the question is not entirely clear. If the \"Crude Death Rate\" is already provided in the table, we can directly retrieve it for the row where deaths are 106,000. If not, we may need to calculate it using the formula:\n\n$$\n\\text{Crude Death Rate} = \\frac{\\text{Number of Deaths}}{\\text{Total Population}} \\times 1000\n$$\n\nSince the total population is not provided in the table, we cannot calculate the crude death rate unless we have that information. However, if the \"Crude Death Rate\" is already stored in the table, we can retrieve it directly.\n\nI will first check if the \"Crude Death Rate\" is already stored in the table for the row where deaths are 106,000. If it is, I will retrieve it. If not, I will need to calculate it, but since the total population is not provided, I cannot proceed with the calculation.\n\nLet me start by checking the table for the \"Crude Death Rate\" value where deaths are 106,000."
