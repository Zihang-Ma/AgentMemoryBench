No specific notes are given in the actress_filmography table.\n\n\nHere are some useful workflows learned from past similar episodes, you can use them to help you complete the task:\nGiven that the task is to find an episode directed by a specific director and within a certain season range, this workflow filters the `episode_table` based on the director's name and the episode number in the season.\n\nFilter rows in {table_name} where {nation_column} is in ['China', 'Japan', 'North Korea'] to get {filtered_rows}\n\nGiven that the task involves ensuring the existence of a competitor with a specific rank before updating, this workflow checks if a competitor with the given rank exists in the 'Figure Skating Competitors' table.\n\n[step 1 description with {variable} placeholders]\n- Query the 'Figure Skating Competitors' table to check if there is a row where the `Rank` is {rank}.\n\n[step 2 description with {variable} placeholders]\n- If the row exists, proceed with the update; otherwise, return an error message indicating the rank does not exist.\n\nGiven that the task is to update the bronze and total medal counts for a specific nation in the Olympic Medal Table, this workflow performs the necessary SQL update operation.\n[step 1 description with {nation}, {bronze_count}, {total_count} placeholders]\nSELECT * FROM {table_name} WHERE Nation = '{nation}';\n[step 2 description with {nation}, {bronze_count}, {total_count} placeholders]\nUPDATE {table_name} SET Bronze = {bronze_count}, Total = {total_count} WHERE Nation = '{nation}';\n\nGiven that the task is to update a specific record in the Monarchies table, this workflow updates the note for a given monarch. [step 1] Identify the monarch to update by their name, {monarch_name}. [step 2] Update the note column for the identified monarch to 'Former monarch'.\n\nGiven that we need to find the number of nations that won no silver medals at all in the 'Olympic Medal Table', this workflow filters and counts the relevant nations.\nSELECT COUNT(*) FROM Olympic_Medal_Table WHERE Silver = 0\n\nGiven that the task is to update the total points of a specific competitor in the 'Figure Skating Competitors' table, this workflow updates the `Total Points` for a given `Rank`.\n\n[step 1 description with {variable} placeholders]\n- Identify the row in the 'Figure Skating Competitors' table where the `Rank` is {rank}.\n\n[step 2 description with {variable} placeholders]\n- Update the `Total Points` column of the identified row to {new_total_points}.\n\nGiven that we need to find the positions of specific drivers in the `Grand Prix Result` table, this workflow extracts their positions.\n[step 1 description with {driver_names} placeholders]\nSELECT Pos FROM Grand Prix Result WHERE Driver IN ({driver_names});\n[step 2 description with {driver_names} placeholders]\ndef compare_positions(positions):\n    maggs_pos, siffert_pos = positions\n    if maggs_pos < siffert_pos:\n        return f\"Tony Maggs came in earlier than Jo Siffert.\"\n    else:\n        return f\"Jo Siffert came in earlier than Tony Maggs.\"\n\nGiven that we need to update a specific record in the `Lawrence_Peckham_0` table, this workflow constructs and executes an `UPDATE` statement to change the position of Lawrence Peckham in the high jump event at the 1984 Olympic Games.\n\nCheck if the table 'Athlete_Results' exists in the database\nSELECT COUNT(*) FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_name = 'Athlete_Results';\nIf the table does not exist, create the table\nCREATE TABLE Athlete_Results (\n    Year VARCHAR(4),\n    Competition VARCHAR(255),\n    Venue VARCHAR(255),\n    Position VARCHAR(10),\n    Event VARCHAR(255),\n    Notes VARCHAR(255)\n);\n"
