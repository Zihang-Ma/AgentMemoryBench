I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

Irving scored the highest with 35 points, Durant got the most rebounds with 10, while Harden had the most assists with 15. The team's record is now 46-23.\n\n\nHere are some useful workflows learned from past similar episodes, you can use them to help you complete the task:\nUpdate the row in the NBA Playoff History table where the team is {team_name} to set the 'Last series win in NBA Playoffs' to {last_series_win}, 'Losing streak' to {losing_streak}, and 'Series losses - teams' to {series_losses_teams}. Verify the update by checking the row for {team_name} in the NBA Playoff History table to ensure the fields have been updated correctly.\n\nGiven that the task is to find the score against Portland in games under 20, this workflow filters the `game_results` table based on the game number and team.\n[step 1 description with {game_number} and {team} placeholders]\nSELECT * FROM game_results WHERE Game < {game_number} AND Team = \\'{team}\\'\n[step 2 description with {score_column} placeholder]\nSELECT {score_column} FROM game_results WHERE Game < {game_number} AND Team = \\'{team}\\'\n\nGiven that we need to update specific information for a player in the `Basketball Players` table, this workflow performs the update operation.\n[step 1 description with {player_name} and {new_height} placeholders]\nUPDATE Basketball_Players\nSET Height = \\'{new_height}\\'\nWHERE Player = \\'{player_name}\\';\n[step 2 description with {new_club} placeholder]\nUPDATE Basketball_Players\nSET Current_Club = \\'{new_club}\\'\nWHERE Player = \\'{player_name}\\';\n\nSelect rows from the table `raiders_game_stats` where the value in the `Game` column is equal to {game_number}. Count the distinct values in the `Raiders first downs` column from the filtered rows.\n\nQuery the standings table to find the row where the Name is {team_name}. Update the Points column of the found row to {new_points}.\n\nGiven a table with a specific column to find the maximum value, this workflow identifies the row with the highest value in that column.\n\nGiven that the task is to update the total points of a specific competitor in the 'Figure Skating Competitors' table, this workflow updates the `Total Points` for a given `Rank`.\n\n[step 1 description with {variable} placeholders]\n- Identify the row in the 'Figure Skating Competitors' table where the `Rank` is {rank}.\n\n[step 2 description with {variable} placeholders]\n- Update the `Total Points` column of the identified row to {new_total_points}.\n\nGiven that the task is to change the state of a specific record in the Monogram_Town_State table, this workflow updates the state based on a given condition. [step 1 description with {monogram} and {new_state} placeholders] [step 2 description with {table_name} placeholder]\\n\\n[step 1 description with {monogram} and {new_state} placeholders]: Update the state to {new_state} for the record where Monogram is equal to {monogram}.\\n[step 2 description with {table_name} placeholder]: Commit the changes to the {table_name} table.\n\nGiven that the task is to modify the capacity of a specific team in the 'Team Information' table, this workflow updates the capacity for a given team.\n\n[step 1 description with {team_name} and {new_capacity} placeholders]\n[step 2 description with {table_name} placeholder]\n\n1.
