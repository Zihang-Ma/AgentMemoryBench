I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer.

Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

Verify the update by checking the row for {team_name} in the NBA Playoff History table to ensure the fields have been updated correctly.\n\nQuery the standings table to find the row where the Name is {team_name}. Update the Points column of the found row to {new_points}.\n\nQuery the standings table to check if the row with Name = {team_name} exists. If the row exists, proceed with the update; otherwise, return an error message indicating the team does not exist.\n\nGiven that we need to update specific information for a player in the `Basketball Players` table, this workflow performs the update operation.\n[step 1 description with {player_name} and {new_height} placeholders]\nUPDATE Basketball_Players\nSET Height = \\'{new_height}\\'\nWHERE Player = \\'{player_name}\\';\n[step 2 description with {new_club} placeholder]\nUPDATE Basketball_Players\nSET Current_Club = \\'{new_club}\\'\nWHERE Player = \\'{player_name}\\';\n\nGiven that the task is to modify the capacity of a specific team in the 'Team Information' table, this workflow updates the capacity for a given team.\n\n[step 1 description with {team_name} and {new_capacity} placeholders]\n[step 2 description with {table_name} placeholder]\n\n1. Identify the row in the 'Team Information' table where the 'Team' column matches '{team_name}'.\n2.

[step 1 description with {table_name} placeholder] [step 2 description with {association_column}, {joining_year_column} placeholders]\n\nGiven that the task is to find the attendance for a specific tie number, this workflow extracts the attendance from the Football Matches table.\n[step 1 description with {tie_number} placeholder]\nSELECT Attendance FROM Football_Matches WHERE Tie_no = {tie_number}\n[step 2 description with {attendance} placeholder]\nattendance = result[0][0]\n\nGiven that we need to find the positions of specific drivers in the `Grand Prix Result` table, this workflow extracts their positions.\n[step 1 description with {driver_names} placeholders]\nSELECT Pos FROM Grand Prix Result WHERE Driver IN ({driver_names});\n[step 2 description with {driver_names} placeholders]\ndef compare_positions(positions):\n    maggs_pos, siffert_pos = positions\n    if maggs_pos < siffert_pos:\n        return f\"Tony Maggs came in earlier than Jo Siffert.\"\n    else:\n        return f\"Jo Siffert came in earlier than Tony Maggs.\"\n\nGiven that the task is to change the state of a specific record in the Monogram_Town_State table, this workflow updates the state based on a given condition. [step 1 description with {monogram} and {new_state} placeholders] [step 2 description with {table_name} placeholder]\\n\\n[step 1 description with {monogram} and {new_state} placeholders]: Update the state to {new_state} for the record where Monogram is equal to {monogram}.\\n[step 2 description with {table_name} placeholder]: Commit the changes to the {table_name} table.\n"
