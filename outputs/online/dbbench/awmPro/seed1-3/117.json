I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

Detroit's record was 7-8-2.\n\n\nHere are some useful workflows learned from past similar episodes, you can use them to help you complete the task:\nGiven that the task is to find the score against Portland in games under 20, this workflow filters the `game_results` table based on the game number and team.\n[step 1 description with {game_number} and {team} placeholders]\nSELECT * FROM game_results WHERE Game < {game_number} AND Team = \\'{team}\\'\n[step 2 description with {score_column} placeholder]\nSELECT {score_column} FROM game_results WHERE Game < {game_number} AND Team = \\'{team}\\'\n\nUpdate the row in the NBA Playoff History table where the team is {team_name} to set the 'Last series win in NBA Playoffs' to {last_series_win}, 'Losing streak' to {losing_streak}, and 'Series losses - teams' to {series_losses_teams}. Verify the update by checking the row for {team_name} in the NBA Playoff History table to ensure the fields have been updated correctly.\n\nLocate the row with the specified position\\n\\nsql\\nSELECT * FROM table_14876228_1 WHERE Position = \\'{position}\\'\\n\\n\\nUpdate the team name for the specified position\\n\\nsql\\nUPDATE table_14876228_1 SET Team = 'Barcelona' WHERE Position = \\'{position}\\'\\n\n\nSelect rows from the table `raiders_game_stats` where the value in the `Game` column is equal to {game_number}. Count the distinct values in the `Raiders first downs` column from the filtered rows.\n\nQuery the standings table to find the row where the Name is {team_name}. Update the Points column of the found row to {new_points}.\n\nQuery the standings table to check if the row with Name = {team_name} exists. If the row exists, proceed with the update; otherwise, return an error message indicating the team does not exist.\n\nGiven that the task is to find the attendance for a specific tie number, this workflow extracts the attendance from the Football Matches table.\n[step 1 description with {tie_number} placeholder]\nSELECT Attendance FROM Football_Matches WHERE Tie_no = {tie_number}\n[step 2 description with {attendance} placeholder]\nattendance = result[0][0]\n\nGiven that the task is to update the total points of a specific competitor in the 'Figure Skating Competitors' table, this workflow updates the `Total Points` for a given `Rank`.\n\n[step 1 description with {variable} placeholders]\n- Identify the row in the 'Figure Skating Competitors' table where the `Rank` is {rank}.\n\n[step 2 description with {variable} placeholders]\n- Update the `Total Points` column of the identified row to {new_total_points}.\n\nGiven that the task is to update the bronze and total medal counts for a specific nation in the Olympic Medal Table, this workflow performs the necessary SQL update operation.\n[step 1 description with {nation}, {bronze_count}, {total_count} placeholders]\nSELECT * FROM {table_name} WHERE Nation = '{nation}';\n[step 2 description with {nation}, {bronze_count}, {total_count} placeholders]\nUPDATE {table_name} SET Bronze = {bronze_count}, Total = {total_count} WHERE Nation = '{nation}';\n\nGiven that the task is to insert a new row into the Athlete_results table, this workflow describes the process of adding a new record with specified details.\n[step 1 description with {year}, {competition}, {venue}, {position}, {event}, and {notes} placeholders]\n[step 2 description with {year}, {competition}, {venue}, {position}, {event}, and {notes} placeholders]\nExample:\nGiven that we need to insert a new row into the Athlete_results table, this workflow outlines the process of adding a new record with the specified details.\nINSERT INTO Athlete_results (Year, Competition, Venue, Position, Event, Notes) VALUES ({year}, {competition}, {venue}, {position}, {event}, {notes});\nCOMMIT;\n"
