I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

Count the distinct values in the `Raiders first downs` column from the filtered rows.\n\nUpdate the row in the NBA Playoff History table where the team is {team_name} to set the 'Last series win in NBA Playoffs' to {last_series_win}, 'Losing streak' to {losing_streak}, and 'Series losses - teams' to {series_losses_teams}. Verify the update by checking the row for {team_name} in the NBA Playoff History table to ensure the fields have been updated correctly.\n\nGiven that we need to find the positions of specific drivers in the `Grand Prix Result` table, this workflow extracts their positions.\n[step 1 description with {driver_names} placeholders]\nSELECT Pos FROM Grand Prix Result WHERE Driver IN ({driver_names});\n[step 2 description with {driver_names} placeholders]\ndef compare_positions(positions):\n    maggs_pos, siffert_pos = positions\n    if maggs_pos < siffert_pos:\n        return f\"Tony Maggs came in earlier than Jo Siffert.\"\n    else:\n        return f\"Jo Siffert came in earlier than Tony Maggs.\"\n\nSum the values in {gold_column} of {filtered_rows} to get {gold_sum}; divide {gold_sum} by 3 to get the average number of gold medals\n\nGiven that the task is to find the attendance for a specific tie number, this workflow extracts the attendance from the Football Matches table.\n[step 1 description with {tie_number} placeholder]\nSELECT Attendance FROM Football_Matches WHERE Tie_no = {tie_number}\n[step 2 description with {attendance} placeholder]\nattendance = result[0][0]\n\nQuery the standings table to find the row where the Name is {team_name}.

Count the distinct values in the selected column.\n\nFilter rows in {table_name} where {nation_column} is in ['China', 'Japan', 'North Korea'] to get {filtered_rows}\n\nGiven that the task is to find the association that joined last, this workflow extracts the latest joining year and its corresponding association from the Football Teams table.
