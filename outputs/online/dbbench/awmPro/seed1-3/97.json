Identify the tournament name to be inserted as {tournament_name}.\n2. Insert the values for games played ({games_played}), points per game ({points_per_game}), rebounds per game ({rebounds_per_game}), and assists per game ({assists_per_game}) into the Basketball Tournament Stats table.\n\nGiven that the task is to update the racing career table with specific details for a given season, this workflow updates the table with the provided information.\n[step 1 description with {season} placeholder]\n[step 2 description with {series}, {races}, {wins}, {podiums}, {points}, and {final_placing} placeholders]\n\n### Steps:\n1. Identify the row in the `racing_career` table where the `Season` is equal to {season}.\n2. Update the `Series`, `Races`, `Wins`, `Podiums`, `Points`, and `Final Placing` columns with the values {series}, {races}, {wins}, {podiums}, {points}, and {final_placing} respectively.\n\nGiven that we need to find the positions of specific drivers in the `Grand Prix Result` table, this workflow extracts their positions.\n[step 1 description with {driver_names} placeholders]\nSELECT Pos FROM Grand Prix Result WHERE Driver IN ({driver_names});\n[step 2 description with {driver_names} placeholders]\ndef compare_positions(positions):\n    maggs_pos, siffert_pos = positions\n    if maggs_pos < siffert_pos:\n        return f\"Tony Maggs came in earlier than Jo Siffert.\"\n    else:\n        return f\"Jo Siffert came in earlier than Tony Maggs.\"\n\nGiven that we need to filter the racers_database table to find entries with specific conditions, this workflow filters the table based on the Entrant and Engine columns.\n[step 1 description with {variable} placeholders]\nsql\nSELECT Year FROM racers_database WHERE Entrant = '{entrant_name}' AND Engine = '{engine_type}'\n\n[step 2 description with {variable} placeholders]\nsql\nSELECT AVG(Year) FROM ({step_1}) AS filtered_data\n\n\nCheck if the table 'Athlete_Results' exists in the database\nSELECT COUNT(*) FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_name = 'Athlete_Results';\nIf the table does not exist, create the table\nCREATE TABLE Athlete_Results (\n    Year VARCHAR(4),\n    Competition VARCHAR(255),\n    Venue VARCHAR(255),\n    Position VARCHAR(10),\n    Event VARCHAR(255),\n    Notes VARCHAR(255)\n);\n\nFilter the rows in the `Golf Champions` table where the `Player` is {player_name} and the `Finish` is {finish_position}. Calculate the average of the `Total` column for the filtered rows.\n\nGiven that the task is to find the score against Portland in games under 20, this workflow filters the `game_results` table based on the game number and team.\n[step 1 description with {game_number} and {team} placeholders]\nSELECT * FROM game_results WHERE Game < {game_number} AND Team = \\'{team}\\'\n[step 2 description with {score_column} placeholder]\nSELECT {score_column} FROM game_results WHERE Game < {game_number} AND Team = \\'{team}\\'\n\nUpdate the row in the Grand Prix racing results table where the No. column matches {race_number} with the values {driver}, {entrant}, {chassis}, and {engine}. Verify the update by checking the row with No. {race_number} in the Grand Prix racing results table to ensure the values match the provided information.\n\nGiven that the task is to update specific fields in the Game Statistics table, this workflow focuses on modifying the high points and high rebounds for a particular game.\n- Update the `High points` column in the `Game Statistics` table for the game with ID `{game_id}` to `{high_points}`.\n- Update the `High rebounds` column in the `Game Statistics` table for the game with ID `{game_id}` to `{high_rebounds}`.\n"
