I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

Verify the update by checking the row for {team_name} in the NBA Playoff History table to ensure the fields have been updated correctly.\n\nGiven that the task is to modify the capacity of a specific team in the 'Team Information' table, this workflow updates the capacity for a given team.\n\n[step 1 description with {team_name} and {new_capacity} placeholders]\n[step 2 description with {table_name} placeholder]\n\n1. Identify the row in the 'Team Information' table where the 'Team' column matches '{team_name}'.\n2. Update the 'Capacity' column of the identified row to '{new_capacity}'.\n\nGiven that the task is to insert data into the 'Athlete Results' table, this workflow specifies the steps to perform the insertion.\nINSERT INTO Athlete_Results (Year, Competition, Venue, Position, Event, Notes) VALUES ({year}, {competition}, {venue}, {position}, {event}, {notes});\nA confirmation message is returned indicating the success or failure of the insertion.\n\nQuery the standings table to find the row where the Name is {team_name}. Update the Points column of the found row to {new_points}.\n\nQuery the standings table to check if the row with Name = {team_name} exists. If the row exists, proceed with the update; otherwise, return an error message indicating the team does not exist.\n\nGiven that the task is to find the attendance for a specific tie number, this workflow extracts the attendance from the Football Matches table.\n[step 1 description with {tie_number} placeholder]\nSELECT Attendance FROM Football_Matches WHERE Tie_no = {tie_number}\n[step 2 description with {attendance} placeholder]\nattendance = result[0][0]\n\nGiven that the task is to find the association that joined last, this workflow extracts the latest joining year and its corresponding association from the Football Teams table.
