I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

Execute the SQL query and return the {column_name} value from the result.\n\nGiven that we need to update the `Champions League Qualification History` table with specific information for a club, this workflow updates the relevant fields for the club in question.\nSELECT club_name FROM Champions_League_Qualification_History WHERE club_name = 'FC Cincinnati';\nUPDATE Champions_League_Qualification_History\nSET last_champions_league_qualification = '{last_qualification_date}',\n    method_of_qualification = '{qualification_method}',\n    length_of_drought = '{drought_length}'\nWHERE club_name = '{club_name};'\n"
