      "content": "To find the average number of laps driven in the Indianapolis 500 by Tony Gulotta, we need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We are working with a table named `Race Results` that contains the headers `Year`, `Car`, `Start`, `Qual`, `Rank`, `Finish`, `Laps`, `Led`, and `Retired`. The goal is to calculate the average number of laps driven by Tony Gulotta in the Indianapolis 500 races he participated in.\n\n2. **Solution Plan**:\n   - First, we need to filter the rows in the `Race Results` table where the driver is Tony Gulotta and the race is the Indianapolis 500.\n   - Then, we will calculate the average of the `Laps` column for these filtered rows.\n\n3. **SQL Query**: Since the question does not specify the exact race name, I will assume that the `Finish` column contains the race name or that the `Year` and `Car` columns can be used to identify the Indianapolis 500 races. If the race name is not explicitly stored, we may need to use other criteria to identify the relevant rows. For now, I will proceed with the assumption that the `Finish` column contains the race name.\n\nI will now execute the SQL query to find the relevant rows for Tony Gulotta in the `Race Results` table.",
