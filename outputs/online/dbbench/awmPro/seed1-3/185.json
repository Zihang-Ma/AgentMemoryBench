[step 1 description with {monogram} and {new_state} placeholders] [step 2 description with {table_name} placeholder]\\n\\n[step 1 description with {monogram} and {new_state} placeholders]: Update the state to {new_state} for the record where Monogram is equal to {monogram}.\\n[step 2 description with {table_name} placeholder]: Commit the changes to the {table_name} table.\n\nFilter rows in {table_name} where {nation_column} is in ['China', 'Japan', 'North Korea'] to get {filtered_rows}\n\nGiven that the task is to update a specific record in the Monarchies table, this workflow updates the note for a given monarch. [step 1] Identify the monarch to update by their name, {monarch_name}. [step 2] Update the note column for the identified monarch to 'Former monarch'.\n\nGiven that the task is to insert data into the 'Athlete Results' table, this workflow specifies the steps to perform the insertion.\nINSERT INTO Athlete_Results (Year, Competition, Venue, Position, Event, Notes) VALUES ({year}, {competition}, {venue}, {position}, {event}, {notes});\nA confirmation message is returned indicating the success or failure of the insertion.\n\nUpdate the row in the NBA Playoff History table where the team is {team_name} to set the 'Last series win in NBA Playoffs' to {last_series_win}, 'Losing streak' to {losing_streak}, and 'Series losses - teams' to {series_losses_teams}. Verify the update by checking the row for {team_name} in the NBA Playoff History table to ensure the fields have been updated correctly.\n\nGiven that the task is to insert a new record into the Alumni table, this workflow handles the insertion process.\n[step 1 description with {name}, {school}, {degree}, {year}, and {description} placeholders]: Prepare the SQL insert statement: INSERT INTO Alumni (Name, School, Degree, Year, Description) VALUES ('{name}', '{school}', '{degree}', '{year}', '{description}');\n[step 2 description with {name}, {school}, {degree}, {year}, and {description} placeholders]: Execute the SQL insert statement using a database connection.\n\nGiven that the task is to insert specific values into the venue_table, this workflow handles the insertion process.\n[step 1 description with {table_name} and {column_names} placeholders]: Connect to the database where the table {table_name} is located.\n[step 2 description with {values} placeholder]: Execute the SQL insert statement with values {values} into the columns {column_names} of the table {table_name}.\n\nWrite a SQL query to select the {column_name} value from the {table_name} table where the {year_column} is less than {year_value} and the {us_billboard_column} is equal to {us_billboard_value}. Execute the SQL query and return the {column_name} value from the result.\n\nQuery the database to select the {column_name} value from the {table_name} table where the {year_column} is less than {year_value} and the {us_billboard_column} is equal to {us_billboard_value}. Execute the SQL query and return the result.\n\nGiven that the task is to find the score against Portland in games under 20, this workflow filters the `game_results` table based on the game number and team.\n[step 1 description with {game_number} and {team} placeholders]\nSELECT * FROM game_results WHERE Game < {game_number} AND Team = \\'{team}\\'\n[step 2 description with {score_column} placeholder]\nSELECT {score_column} FROM game_results WHERE Game < {game_number} AND Team = \\'{team}\\'\n"
