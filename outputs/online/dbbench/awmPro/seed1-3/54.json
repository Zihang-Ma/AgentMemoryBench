I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

[step 1 description with {table_name} placeholder] [step 2 description with {association_column}, {joining_year_column} placeholders]\n\nUpdate the row in the NBA Playoff History table where the team is {team_name} to set the 'Last series win in NBA Playoffs' to {last_series_win}, 'Losing streak' to {losing_streak}, and 'Series losses - teams' to {series_losses_teams}. Verify the update by checking the row for {team_name} in the NBA Playoff History table to ensure the fields have been updated correctly.\n\nGiven that we need to update specific information for a player in the `Basketball Players` table, this workflow performs the update operation.\n[step 1 description with {player_name} and {new_height} placeholders]\nUPDATE Basketball_Players\nSET Height = \\'{new_height}\\'\nWHERE Player = \\'{player_name}\\';\n[step 2 description with {new_club} placeholder]\nUPDATE Basketball_Players\nSET Current_Club = \\'{new_club}\\'\nWHERE Player = \\'{player_name}\\';\n\nSelect rows from the table `raiders_game_stats` where the value in the `Game` column is equal to {game_number}. Count the distinct values in the `Raiders first downs` column from the filtered rows.\n\nQuery the standings table to find the row where the Name is {team_name}. Update the Points column of the found row to {new_points}.\n\nGiven that the task is to modify the capacity of a specific team in the 'Team Information' table, this workflow updates the capacity for a given team.\n\n[step 1 description with {team_name} and {new_capacity} placeholders]\n[step 2 description with {table_name} placeholder]\n\n1. Identify the row in the 'Team Information' table where the 'Team' column matches '{team_name}'.\n2. Update the 'Capacity' column of the identified row to '{new_capacity}'.\n\nGiven that the task is to insert data into the 'Athlete Results' table, this workflow specifies the steps to perform the insertion.\nINSERT INTO Athlete_Results (Year, Competition, Venue, Position, Event, Notes) VALUES ({year}, {competition}, {venue}, {position}, {event}, {notes});\nA confirmation message is returned indicating the success or failure of the insertion.\n\nQuery the standings table to check if the row with Name = {team_name} exists. If the row exists, proceed with the update; otherwise, return an error message indicating the team does not exist.\n\nFind a coach who won promotion to the first tier by filtering the Coaches table. [step 1 description: Select the row where the 'Honours' column contains 'Won promotion to first tier'] [step 2 description: Extract the coach's name from the selected row]\n"

To answer this, we need to query the `football_player_statistics` table and filter the data based on the `Period` column to find the maximum number of goals in each of the two specified time ranges.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n1. **Filter the data for the period 1972–1975** and find the maximum number of goals in that range.\n2. **Filter the data for the period 1976–1982** and find the maximum number of goals in that range.\n3. **Return the results** for both time periods.\n\n### First, I will execute the SQL query to find the most goals for the period 1972–1975.",
