      "content": "The question is asking for the **lowest game** where the **score was 108-85**. Based on the table `game score`, which contains the headers `Game`, `Date`, `Opponent`, `Score`, `Location`, and `Record`, we need to find the game with the score `108-85` and determine which one is the \"lowest\" game. However, the term \"lowest game\" is ambiguous. It could mean the game with the lowest score (i.e., the team's score is the lowest), or it could refer to the game with the lowest ranking in terms of the team's performance (e.g., the game with the worst record). \n\nSince the `Score` column contains the score of the game (e.g., `108-85`), and the `Record` column likely contains the team's overall win-loss record, I will assume that \"lowest game\" refers to the game with the **lowest score for the team** (i.e., the team's score is the smaller number in the `Score` field). For example, in `108-85`, the team's score is `108`, and the opponent's score is `85`. If we are to find the \"lowest game\" for the team, we would look for the game where the team's score is the smallest.\n\nTo proceed, I will:\n1. Filter the `game score` table for the row where the `Score` is `108-85`.\n2. Extract the team's score (the first number in the `Score` field) and determine if it is the lowest.\n\nI will now execute the SQL query to find the row with the score `108-85`.",
