I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

Execute the constructed SQL statement using a database connection.\n\nGiven that the task is to update the bronze and total medal counts for a specific nation in the Olympic Medal Table, this workflow performs the necessary SQL update operation.\n[step 1 description with {nation}, {bronze_count}, {total_count} placeholders]\nSELECT * FROM {table_name} WHERE Nation = '{nation}';\n[step 2 description with {nation}, {bronze_count}, {total_count} placeholders]\nUPDATE {table_name} SET Bronze = {bronze_count}, Total = {total_count} WHERE Nation = '{nation}';\n\nGiven that the task is to find the score against Portland in games under 20, this workflow filters the `game_results` table based on the game number and team.\n[step 1 description with {game_number} and {team} placeholders]\nSELECT * FROM game_results WHERE Game < {game_number} AND Team = \\'{team}\\'\n[step 2 description with {score_column} placeholder]\nSELECT {score_column} FROM game_results WHERE Game < {game_number} AND Team = \\'{team}\\'\n\nGiven that we need to find the number of nations that won no silver medals at all in the 'Olympic Medal Table', this workflow filters and counts the relevant nations.\nSELECT COUNT(*) FROM Olympic_Medal_Table WHERE Silver = 0\n\nLocate the row with the specified position\\n\\nsql\\nSELECT * FROM table_14876228_1 WHERE Position = \\'{position}\\'\\n\\n\\nUpdate the team name for the specified position\\n\\nsql\\nUPDATE table_14876228_1 SET Team = 'Barcelona' WHERE Position = \\'{position}\\'\\n\n\nGiven that we need to update a specific record in the `Lawrence_Peckham_0` table, this workflow constructs and executes an `UPDATE` statement to change the position of Lawrence Peckham in the high jump event at the 1984 Olympic Games.\n"
