I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

Update the Points column of the found row to {new_points}.\n\nGiven that the task is to update a specific player's 'Runs' attribute in the 'CricketPlayers' table, this workflow updates the 'Runs' value for a given player.\n[step 1 description with {player_name} and {runs_value} placeholders]\n[step 2 description with {table_name} placeholder]\n\n### Steps:\n1. Identify the player with the name {player_name} in the 'CricketPlayers' table.\n2. Update the 'Runs' attribute of the identified player to {runs_value}.\n\nCheck if the table 'Athlete_Results' exists in the database\nSELECT COUNT(*) FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_name = 'Athlete_Results';\nIf the table does not exist, create the table\nCREATE TABLE Athlete_Results (\n    Year VARCHAR(4),\n    Competition VARCHAR(255),\n    Venue VARCHAR(255),\n    Position VARCHAR(10),\n    Event VARCHAR(255),\n    Notes VARCHAR(255)\n);\n\nUpdate the Notes column for the row where Hotel is equal to {hotel_name} in the Hotels table with the value {new_notes}.
