Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer.

[step 1 description with {monogram} and {new_state} placeholders] [step 2 description with {table_name} placeholder]\\n\\n[step 1 description with {monogram} and {new_state} placeholders]: Update the state to {new_state} for the record where Monogram is equal to {monogram}.\\n[step 2 description with {table_name} placeholder]: Commit the changes to the {table_name} table.\n\nGiven that the task is to find the association that joined last, this workflow extracts the latest joining year and its corresponding association from the Football Teams table. [step 1 description with {table_name} placeholder] [step 2 description with {association_column}, {joining_year_column} placeholders]\n\nUpdate the `Total` column to `{total_value}` for the row where the `Nationality` column equals `{nationality}` in the table `{table_name}`. Verify the update by checking the row in the `{table_name}` table.\n\nGiven that the task is to find the score against Portland in games under 20, this workflow filters the `game_results` table based on the game number and team.\n[step 1 description with {game_number} and {team} placeholders]\nSELECT * FROM game_results WHERE Game < {game_number} AND Team = \\'{team}\\'\n[step 2 description with {score_column} placeholder]\nSELECT {score_column} FROM game_results WHERE Game < {game_number} AND Team = \\'{team}\\'\n\nSelect rows from the table `raiders_game_stats` where the value in the `Game` column is equal to {game_number}. Count the distinct values in the `Raiders first downs` column from the filtered rows.\n\nGiven that the task is to insert specific values into the venue_table, this workflow handles the insertion process.\n[step 1 description with {table_name} and {column_names} placeholders]: Connect to the database where the table {table_name} is located.\n[step 2 description with {values} placeholder]: Execute the SQL insert statement with values {values} into the columns {column_names} of the table {table_name}.\n\nGiven that we need to update specific information for a player in the `Basketball Players` table, this workflow performs the update operation.\n[step 1 description with {player_name} and {new_height} placeholders]\nUPDATE Basketball_Players\nSET Height = \\'{new_height}\\'\nWHERE Player = \\'{player_name}\\';\n[step 2 description with {new_club} placeholder]\nUPDATE Basketball_Players\nSET Current_Club = \\'{new_club}\\'\nWHERE Player = \\'{player_name}\\';\n\nGiven that we need to filter rows based on specific district and committee, this workflow extracts the relevant rows.\n[step 1 description: Filter rows where the district is {district} and committee is {committee}]\nfiltered_rows = df[(df['District'] == {district}) & (df['Committee'] == {committee})]\n[step 2 description: Calculate the average first elected year from the filtered rows]\naverage_first_elected_year = filtered_rows['First Elected'].mean()\n\nGiven that the task is to modify the capacity of a specific team in the 'Team Information' table, this workflow updates the capacity for a given team.\n\n[step 1 description with {team_name} and {new_capacity} placeholders]\n[step 2 description with {table_name} placeholder]\n\n1. Identify the row in the 'Team Information' table where the 'Team' column matches '{team_name}'.\n2. Update the 'Capacity' column of the identified row to '{new_capacity}'.\n\nGiven that the task is to update a specific record in the Monarchies table, this workflow updates the note for a given monarch. [step 1] Identify the monarch to update by their name, {monarch_name}. [step 2] Update the note column for the identified monarch to 'Former monarch'.\n"
