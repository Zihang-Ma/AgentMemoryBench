I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

[step 1 description with {monogram} and {new_state} placeholders] [step 2 description with {table_name} placeholder]\\n\\n[step 1 description with {monogram} and {new_state} placeholders]: Update the state to {new_state} for the record where Monogram is equal to {monogram}.\\n[step 2 description with {table_name} placeholder]: Commit the changes to the {table_name} table.\n\nInsert the record with the following details: {branch_name} located at {address} in {neighborhood}, first opened in {first_opened} and currently opened in {current_opened}. Ensure the record is added to the 'Library Locations' table named {table_name}.\n\nLocate the row with the specified position\\n\\nsql\\nSELECT * FROM table_14876228_1 WHERE Position = \\'{position}\\'\\n\\n\\nUpdate the team name for the specified position\\n\\nsql\\nUPDATE table_14876228_1 SET Team = 'Barcelona' WHERE Position = \\'{position}\\'\\n\n\nFilter rows in {table_name} where {nation_column} is in ['China', 'Japan', 'North Korea'] to get {filtered_rows}\n\nLocate the row in the {table_name} where the 'Driver' column value is equal to {driver_name}. Update the 'Time/Retired' column of the located row to {time_to_add}.\n\nGiven that the task is to update the elevation of a specific mountain peak in the 'Mountain Peaks' table, this workflow handles the SQL update operation.\n[step 1 description with {mountain_peak} and {new_elevation} placeholders]\nUPDATE `Mountain_Peaks` SET `Elevation` = '{new_elevation}' WHERE `Mountain_Peak` = '{mountain_peak}';\n[step 2 description with {mountain_peak} placeholder]\nSELECT * FROM `Mountain_Peaks` WHERE `Mountain_Peak` = '{mountain_peak}' LIMIT 1;\n\nUpdate the 'Date' and 'Sculptor' columns for the row where 'Title' is '{title}' in the 'Commemorative Sculptures' table to '{new_date}' and '{new_sculptor}' respectively.\nVerify the update by checking the row where 'Title' is '{title}' to ensure the 'Date' and 'Sculptor' have been updated correctly.\n\nGiven that the task involves updating a specific entry in a table, this workflow is designed to locate and modify a record based on a key field.\n\n[step 1] Load the table data into a DataFrame.\n[step 2] Filter the DataFrame to find the row where 'Name' is 'Windsor Castle'.\n[step 3] Update the 'Year Listed' column of the found row to 1992.\n[step 4] Save the updated DataFrame back to the table.\n\nGiven that the task is to find the score against Portland in games under 20, this workflow filters the `game_results` table based on the game number and team.\n[step 1 description with {game_number} and {team} placeholders]\nSELECT * FROM game_results WHERE Game < {game_number} AND Team = \\'{team}\\'\n[step 2 description with {score_column} placeholder]\nSELECT {score_column} FROM game_results WHERE Game < {game_number} AND Team = \\'{team}\\'\n\nGiven that the task requires finding the seat position for a specific person, this workflow is designed to locate the correct row based on the seat position.\n1. Locate the row in the `Seat Order Table` where the seat position is {position} from the right to the left.\n2. Extract the value in the `{seat_order}` column for the located row to identify the person's name.\n"
