I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

Verify the update by checking the row for {team_name} in the NBA Playoff History table to ensure the fields have been updated correctly.\n\nGiven that the task is to insert data into the 'Athlete Results' table, this workflow specifies the steps to perform the insertion.\nINSERT INTO Athlete_Results (Year, Competition, Venue, Position, Event, Notes) VALUES ({year}, {competition}, {venue}, {position}, {event}, {notes});\nA confirmation message is returned indicating the success or failure of the insertion.\n\nGiven that the task is to find the score against Portland in games under 20, this workflow filters the `game_results` table based on the game number and team.\n[step 1 description with {game_number} and {team} placeholders]\nSELECT * FROM game_results WHERE Game < {game_number} AND Team = \\'{team}\\'\n[step 2 description with {score_column} placeholder]\nSELECT {score_column} FROM game_results WHERE Game < {game_number} AND Team = \\'{team}\\'\n\nUpdate the `Total` column to `{total_value}` for the row where the `Nationality` column equals `{nationality}` in the table `{table_name}`. Verify the update by checking the row in the `{table_name}` table.\n\nGiven that the task is to change the state of a specific record in the Monogram_Town_State table, this workflow updates the state based on a given condition. [step 1 description with {monogram} and {new_state} placeholders] [step 2 description with {table_name} placeholder]\\n\\n[step 1 description with {monogram} and {new_state} placeholders]: Update the state to {new_state} for the record where Monogram is equal to {monogram}.\\n[step 2 description with {table_name} placeholder]: Commit the changes to the {table_name} table.\n\nQuery the standings table to find the row where the Name is {team_name}. Update the Points column of the found row to {new_points}.\n\nGiven that the task involves ensuring the existence of a competitor with a specific rank before updating, this workflow checks if a competitor with the given rank exists in the 'Figure Skating Competitors' table.\n\n[step 1 description with {variable} placeholders]\n- Query the 'Figure Skating Competitors' table to check if there is a row where the `Rank` is {rank}.\n\n[step 2 description with {variable} placeholders]\n- If the row exists, proceed with the update; otherwise, return an error message indicating the rank does not exist.\n\nGiven that we need to update specific information for a player in the `Basketball Players` table, this workflow performs the update operation.\n[step 1 description with {player_name} and {new_height} placeholders]\nUPDATE Basketball_Players\nSET Height = \\'{new_height}\\'\nWHERE Player = \\'{player_name}\\';\n[step 2 description with {new_club} placeholder]\nUPDATE Basketball_Players\nSET Current_Club = \\'{new_club}\\'\nWHERE Player = \\'{player_name}\\';\n"
