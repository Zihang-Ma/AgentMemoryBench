The game results were then inserted into a database table called Baseball Game Results.\n\n\nHere are some useful workflows learned from past similar episodes, you can use them to help you complete the task:\nGiven that the task is to find the score against Portland in games under 20, this workflow filters the `game_results` table based on the game number and team.\n[step 1 description with {game_number} and {team} placeholders]\nSELECT * FROM game_results WHERE Game < {game_number} AND Team = \\'{team}\\'\n[step 2 description with {score_column} placeholder]\nSELECT {score_column} FROM game_results WHERE Game < {game_number} AND Team = \\'{team}\\'\n\nUpdate the row in the NBA Playoff History table where the team is {team_name} to set the 'Last series win in NBA Playoffs' to {last_series_win}, 'Losing streak' to {losing_streak}, and 'Series losses - teams' to {series_losses_teams}. Verify the update by checking the row for {team_name} in the NBA Playoff History table to ensure the fields have been updated correctly.\n\nGiven that the task is to update the opponent value for a specific game in the 'Game Records' table, this workflow performs the necessary update.\n[step 1 description: Find the row with game number {game_number} in the 'Game Records' table.]\n[step 2 description: Update the 'Opponent' column of the found row to 'New York Rangers'].\n\nLocate the row with the specified position\\n\\nsql\\nSELECT * FROM table_14876228_1 WHERE Position = \\'{position}\\'\\n\\n\\nUpdate the team name for the specified position\\n\\nsql\\nUPDATE table_14876228_1 SET Team = 'Barcelona' WHERE Position = \\'{position}\\'\\n\n\nGiven that the task is to insert specific statistics into the Basketball Tournament Stats table, this workflow describes how to perform the insertion.\n[step 1 description with {tournament_name} placeholder]\n[step 2 description with {games_played} {points_per_game} {rebounds_per_game} {assists_per_game} placeholders]\n\n1. Identify the tournament name to be inserted as {tournament_name}.\n2. Insert the values for games played ({games_played}), points per game ({points_per_game}), rebounds per game ({rebounds_per_game}), and assists per game ({assists_per_game}) into the Basketball Tournament Stats table.\n\nCheck if the table 'Athlete_Results' exists in the database\nSELECT COUNT(*) FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_name = 'Athlete_Results';\nIf the table does not exist, create the table\nCREATE TABLE Athlete_Results (\n    Year VARCHAR(4),\n    Competition VARCHAR(255),\n    Venue VARCHAR(255),\n    Position VARCHAR(10),\n    Event VARCHAR(255),\n    Notes VARCHAR(255)\n);\n\nGiven that the task is to insert a new row into the Athlete_results table, this workflow describes the process of adding a new record with specified details.\n[step 1 description with {year}, {competition}, {venue}, {position}, {event}, and {notes} placeholders]\n[step 2 description with {year}, {competition}, {venue}, {position}, {event}, and {notes} placeholders]\nExample:\nGiven that we need to insert a new row into the Athlete_results table, this workflow outlines the process of adding a new record with the specified details.\nINSERT INTO Athlete_results (Year, Competition, Venue, Position, Event, Notes) VALUES ({year}, {competition}, {venue}, {position}, {event}, {notes});\nCOMMIT;\n\nGiven that we have inserted medal information into the `Olympic_Medalists` table, this workflow verifies the insertion.\n[step 1 description with {name} placeholder]\nSELECT * FROM Olympic_Medalists WHERE Name = '{name}';\n[step 2 description with {expected_medal}, {expected_sport}, {expected_event}, {expected_date} placeholders]\n-- Check if the inserted values match the expected values\nSELECT COUNT(*) FROM Olympic_Medalists WHERE Name = '{name}' AND Medal = '{expected_medal}' AND Sport = '{expected_sport}' AND Event = '{expected_event}' AND Date = '{expected_date}';\n\nGiven that the task is to update specific fields in the Game Statistics table, this workflow focuses on modifying the high points and high rebounds for a particular game.\n- Update the `High points` column in the `Game Statistics` table for the game with ID `{game_id}` to `{high_points}`.\n- Update the `High rebounds` column in the `Game Statistics` table for the game with ID `{game_id}` to `{high_rebounds}`.\n\nSelect rows from the table `raiders_game_stats` where the value in the `Game` column is equal to {game_number}.
