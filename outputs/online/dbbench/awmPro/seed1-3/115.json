I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

The team suffered a loss, with Cotton having a record of 3-3. The game had an attendance of 30,000, bringing the team's overall record to 30-27. The game results were inserted into the database using the following values: Date='June 2', Opponent='Red Sox', Score='3 - 2', Loss='Cotton (3-3)', Attendance='30,000', and Record='30-27'.\n\n\nHere are some useful workflows learned from past similar episodes, you can use them to help you complete the task:\nGiven that the task is to find the score against Portland in games under 20, this workflow filters the `game_results` table based on the game number and team.\n[step 1 description with {game_number} and {team} placeholders]\nSELECT * FROM game_results WHERE Game < {game_number} AND Team = \\'{team}\\'\n[step 2 description with {score_column} placeholder]\nSELECT {score_column} FROM game_results WHERE Game < {game_number} AND Team = \\'{team}\\'\n\nUpdate the row in the NBA Playoff History table where the team is {team_name} to set the 'Last series win in NBA Playoffs' to {last_series_win}, 'Losing streak' to {losing_streak}, and 'Series losses - teams' to {series_losses_teams}. Verify the update by checking the row for {team_name} in the NBA Playoff History table to ensure the fields have been updated correctly.\n\nGiven that the task is to find the attendance for a specific tie number, this workflow extracts the attendance from the Football Matches table.\n[step 1 description with {tie_number} placeholder]\nSELECT Attendance FROM Football_Matches WHERE Tie_no = {tie_number}\n[step 2 description with {attendance} placeholder]\nattendance = result[0][0]\n\nSelect rows from the table `raiders_game_stats` where the value in the `Game` column is equal to {game_number}. Count the distinct values in the `Raiders first downs` column from the filtered rows.\n\nQuery the standings table to find the row where the Name is {team_name}. Update the Points column of the found row to {new_points}.\n\nQuery the standings table to check if the row with Name = {team_name} exists. If the row exists, proceed with the update; otherwise, return an error message indicating the team does not exist.\n\nGiven that the task is to insert a new row into the Athlete_results table, this workflow describes the process of adding a new record with specified details.\n[step 1 description with {year}, {competition}, {venue}, {position}, {event}, and {notes} placeholders]\n[step 2 description with {year}, {competition}, {venue}, {position}, {event}, and {notes} placeholders]\nExample:\nGiven that we need to insert a new row into the Athlete_results table, this workflow outlines the process of adding a new record with the specified details.\nINSERT INTO Athlete_results (Year, Competition, Venue, Position, Event, Notes) VALUES ({year}, {competition}, {venue}, {position}, {event}, {notes});\nCOMMIT;\n\nGiven that the task is to change the state of a specific record in the Monogram_Town_State table, this workflow updates the state based on a given condition. [step 1 description with {monogram} and {new_state} placeholders] [step 2 description with {table_name} placeholder]\\n\\n[step 1 description with {monogram} and {new_state} placeholders]: Update the state to {new_state} for the record where Monogram is equal to {monogram}.\\n[step 2 description with {table_name} placeholder]: Commit the changes to the {table_name} table.\n\nGiven that we need to find the positions of specific drivers in the `Grand Prix Result` table, this workflow extracts their positions.\n[step 1 description with {driver_names} placeholders]\nSELECT Pos FROM Grand Prix Result WHERE Driver IN ({driver_names});\n[step 2 description with {driver_names} placeholders]\ndef compare_positions(positions):\n    maggs_pos, siffert_pos = positions\n    if maggs_pos < siffert_pos:\n        return f\"Tony Maggs came in earlier than Jo Siffert.\"\n    else:\n        return f\"Jo Siffert came in earlier than Tony Maggs.\"\n\nGiven that the task is to modify the capacity of a specific team in the 'Team Information' table, this workflow updates the capacity for a given team.\n\n[step 1 description with {team_name} and {new_capacity} placeholders]\n[step 2 description with {table_name} placeholder]\n\n1. Identify the row in the 'Team Information' table where the 'Team' column matches '{team_name}'.\n2. Update the 'Capacity' column of the identified row to '{new_capacity}'.\n"
