I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

Check if the value in the {appearances_column} for the filtered row is less than 2. If true, return true; otherwise, return false.\n\nGiven that the task is to find the attendance for a specific tie number, this workflow extracts the attendance from the Football Matches table.\n[step 1 description with {tie_number} placeholder]\nSELECT Attendance FROM Football_Matches WHERE Tie_no = {tie_number}\n[step 2 description with {attendance} placeholder]\nattendance = result[0][0]\n\nFilter leagues other than NPSL that the New York men's soccer team has played in. [step 1 Query the 'Soccer Team Performance Table' to find all leagues that the New York men's soccer team has played in with league_to_exclude = 'NPSL'] [step 2 Extract the unique league names from the remaining rows with league_results]\n\nFind the row in the Team_Location_Stadium table where the Team column matches {team_name}. Extract the values from the Location and Stadium columns for the row where the Team column matches {team_name}.\n\nGiven that we need to update the `Champions League Qualification History` table with specific information for a club, this workflow updates the relevant fields for the club in question.\nSELECT club_name FROM Champions_League_Qualification_History WHERE club_name = 'FC Cincinnati';\nUPDATE Champions_League_Qualification_History\nSET last_champions_league_qualification = '{last_qualification_date}',\n    method_of_qualification = '{qualification_method}',\n    length_of_drought = '{drought_length}'\nWHERE club_name = '{club_name};'\n\nFilter the rows in the {table_name} where the Club is {team_name}. From the filtered rows, select the rows where the value in the {appearances_column} is less than 2. Sum the Wins column for these rows to get the total wins.\n\nFind the row in the Team_Location_Stadium table where the Team column matches {team_name}. Update the Stadium column to {stadium_name} and the Location column to {location} for the row where the Team column matches {team_name}.\n\nGiven that we need to calculate the total number of goals scored by specific players, this workflow extracts and sums the goals.\n[step 1 description with {player_name} placeholder]\n- Query the `Total Goals` for the player `{player_name}` from the `Player Goals in International Tournaments` table.\n[step 2 description with {player_name} placeholder]\n- Sum the `Total Goals` for both players.\n"
