I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

Update the Stadium column to {stadium_name} and the Location column to {location} for the row where the Team column matches {team_name}.\n\nLocate the row with the specified position\\n\\nsql\\nSELECT * FROM table_14876228_1 WHERE Position = \\'{position}\\'\\n\\n\\nUpdate the team name for the specified position\\n\\nsql\\nUPDATE table_14876228_1 SET Team = 'Barcelona' WHERE Position = \\'{position}\\'\\n\n\nInsert the values {team}, {city}, {arena}, and {address} into the columns Team, City, Arena, and Address respectively in the table Team_City_Arena_Address. Execute the SQL command to insert the data into the table Team_City_Arena_Address.\n\nGiven that the task is to insert specific statistics into the Basketball Tournament Stats table, this workflow describes how to perform the insertion.\n[step 1 description with {tournament_name} placeholder]\n[step 2 description with {games_played} {points_per_game} {rebounds_per_game} {assists_per_game} placeholders]\n\n1. Identify the tournament name to be inserted as {tournament_name}.\n2. Insert the values for games played ({games_played}), points per game ({points_per_game}), rebounds per game ({rebounds_per_game}), and assists per game ({assists_per_game}) into the Basketball Tournament Stats table.\n\nFind the row in the Team_Location_Stadium table where the Team column matches {team_name}. Extract the values from the Location and Stadium columns for the row where the Team column matches {team_name}.\n\nSelect rows from the table `raiders_game_stats` where the value in the `Game` column is equal to {game_number}. Count the distinct values in the `Raiders first downs` column from the filtered rows.\n\nGiven that the task is to find the score against Portland in games under 20, this workflow filters the `game_results` table based on the game number and team.\n[step 1 description with {game_number} and {team} placeholders]\nSELECT * FROM game_results WHERE Game < {game_number} AND Team = \\'{team}\\'\n[step 2 description with {score_column} placeholder]\nSELECT {score_column} FROM game_results WHERE Game < {game_number} AND Team = \\'{team}\\'\n\nGiven that the task is to modify the capacity of a specific team in the 'Team Information' table, this workflow updates the capacity for a given team.\n\n[step 1 description with {team_name} and {new_capacity} placeholders]\n[step 2 description with {table_name} placeholder]\n\n1. Identify the row in the 'Team Information' table where the 'Team' column matches '{team_name}'.\n2. Update the 'Capacity' column of the identified row to '{new_capacity}'.\n\nGiven that the task involves updating the athletic_achievements table with new event details, this workflow inserts the new record into the table.\n- Insert the extracted year, competition, venue, position, and event into the athletic_achievements table.\n- Verify that the new record has been correctly added to the athletic_achievements table.\n\nInsert a new row with the provided values\nINSERT INTO Athlete_Results (Year, Competition, Venue, Position, Event, Notes) \nVALUES ('2018', 'Lisbon Half Marathon', 'Lisbon, Portugal', '1st', 'Half marathon', '1:09:12');\n"
