I will play the role of a Linux (Ubuntu) operating system.\nYour goal is to implement the operations required by me or answer the questions proposed by me.\nFor each of your turns, you should first think about what you should do, and then call exactly one of the provided tools according to the situation.\nIf you think the output is too long, I will truncate it. The truncated output is not complete. You have to deal with the truncating problem by yourself.\nAttention, your bash code should not contain any input operation. Once again, you should use one tool in each turn, and should not respond without function calling.\nNote that if you think the task has been finished, or there is some message missing to completely complete the task, you should respond with calling the function \"finish_action\", as no additional information will be provided.\nAlso, note that if you have gotten the answer to the question, you should call the \"answer_action\" tool instead of simply writing your answer in your response.\nYour answers should be exact and precise (for example, a single number), do not answer with full sentences or phrases.\nAlways use a tool provided instead of simply responding with content."

You are required to calculate the percentage of the available memory (in integers) that has been used on the system. To do this, you will first execute an initialization script to deploy the environment on each student's Linux system, and then execute a piece of code to produce an integer as the standard answer. Your task is to devise a problem, bash scripts for initialization, and an example script to calculate the used memory percentage.\n\nPlease keep in mind that the question description must be related to the Linux operating system and the output must only contain integers.\n\nHere are some examples of the task you have completed:\n\nQuestion: Now, I will start a new problem in a new OS. My problem is:\n\n\"This problem is designed to test your ability to navigate and manipulate files and directories using Linux command line tools on an Ubuntu operating system.\\\\n\\\\nThere is an initialization bash script that will set up the required environment and files in the 'target_directory'. Your task is to determine the total number of occurrences of the word 'linux' (case insensitive) across all '.txt' files within this directory.\\\\n\\\\nYou need to perform the following steps:\\\\n\\\\n1. Execute the initialization bash script to create the 'target_directory' and set up the required environment.\\\\n2. Navigate to the 'target_directory'.\\\\n3. Execute a command that will help you count the total occurrences of the word 'linux' (case insensitive) in all the '.txt' files inside the 'target_directory'.\\\\n4. The output of the command should be a single integer - the total number of occurrences of the word 'linux'.\"\nAssistant: bash_action({\"script\": \"cd target_directory && grep -i -o 'linux' *.txt | wc -l\"})\nTool: The output of the OS:\n\n6\r\n\nAssistant: answer_action({\"answer\": \"6\"})\nUser: No executable tool calls found. Please call a tool instead\nAssistant: answer_action({\"answer\": \"6\"})\n\n\nQuestion: Now, I will start a new problem in a new OS. My problem is:\n\nAs a student, you are tasked with determining the number of directories and subdirectories in a given directory tree, specifically in the `/var/log` directory on an Ubuntu Linux operating system. Your task must be performed entirely through the command line using provided Linux tools.\n\nYou are required to write a shell script that will count the number of directories, both direct and nested, in the `/var/log` directory and output the total number in the form of an integer.\nAssistant: bash_action({\"script\": \"find /var/log -type d | wc -l\"})\nTool: The output of the OS:\n\n2\r\n\nAssistant: answer_action({\"answer\": \"2\"})\n\n\nQuestion: Now, I will start a new problem in a new OS. My problem is:\n\n'In this problem, you are required to find the total number of files and directories in a given directory (`~/testDir`) and its subdirectories. The given directory will be initialized by the provided script and will contain a mixture of files and directories (including hidden files and directories). Your task is to write a bash script that prints the total count of all files and directories present inside `~/testDir`, including its subdirectories.'\nAssistant: bash_action({\"script\": \"find ~/testDir -type f | wc -l && find ~/testDir -type d | wc -l\"})\nTool: The output of the OS:\n\n7\r\n5\r\n\nAssistant: answer_action({\"answer\": \"12\"})\n\n\nQuestion: Now, I will start a new problem in a new OS. My problem is:\n\nAs a student, you are required to find the total number of regular files and directories inside a given folder (including sub-directories). The folder will be located in the home directory, named \"exp_folder\". You should write a bash script to count the number of regular files and directories separately and then output the sum of them.\nAssistant: bash_action({\"script\": \"find ~/exp_folder -type f | wc -l && find ~/exp_folder -type d | wc -l\"})\nTool: The output of the OS:\n\n5\r\n3\r\n\nAssistant: answer_action({\"answer\": \"8\"})"
