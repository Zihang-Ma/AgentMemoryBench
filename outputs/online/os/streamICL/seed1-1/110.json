I will play the role of a Linux (Ubuntu) operating system.\nYour goal is to implement the operations required by me or answer the questions proposed by me.\nFor each of your turns, you should first think about what you should do, and then call exactly one of the provided tools according to the situation.\nIf you think the output is too long, I will truncate it. The truncated output is not complete. You have to deal with the truncating problem by yourself.\nAttention, your bash code should not contain any input operation. Once again, you should use one tool in each turn, and should not respond without function calling.\nNote that if you think the task has been finished, or there is some message missing to completely complete the task, you should respond with calling the function \"finish_action\", as no additional information will be provided.\nAlso, note that if you have gotten the answer to the question, you should call the \"answer_action\" tool instead of simply writing your answer in your response.\nYour answers should be exact and precise (for example, a single number), do not answer with full sentences or phrases.\nAlways use a tool provided instead of simply responding with content."

Each subdirectory contains an unknown number of text files. Your task is to find out the total number of lines across all the text files in all the subdirectories. To achieve this, you will have to write a Linux command that will output this total number of lines.\n\nHere are some examples of the task you have completed:\n\nQuestion: Now, I will start a new problem in a new OS. My problem is:\n\nAs a student, you are required to find the total number of regular files and directories inside a given folder (including sub-directories). The folder will be located in the home directory, named \"exp_folder\". You should write a bash script to count the number of regular files and directories separately and then output the sum of them.\nAssistant: bash_action({\"script\": \"find ~/exp_folder -type f | wc -l && find ~/exp_folder -type d | wc -l\"})\nTool: The output of the OS:\n\n5\r\n3\r\n\nAssistant: answer_action({\"answer\": \"8\"})\n\n\nQuestion: Now, I will start a new problem in a new OS. My problem is:\n\nAs a student, you are tasked with determining the number of directories and subdirectories in a given directory tree, specifically in the `/var/log` directory on an Ubuntu Linux operating system. Your task must be performed entirely through the command line using provided Linux tools.\n\nYou are required to write a shell script that will count the number of directories, both direct and nested, in the `/var/log` directory and output the total number in the form of an integer.\nAssistant: bash_action({\"script\": \"find /var/log -type d | wc -l\"})\nTool: The output of the OS:\n\n2\r\n\nAssistant: answer_action({\"answer\": \"2\"})\n\n\nQuestion: Now, I will start a new problem in a new OS. My problem is:\n\nAs a student, you are asked to create a directory structure under your home directory and determine the total number of created directories as your answer. The created directory structure is outlined as follows:\n\n1. Create a main directory named \"StudentFiles\" in your home directory.\n2. Inside \"StudentFiles,\" create three sub-directories named \"ClassA\", \"ClassB\", and \"ClassC\".\n3. In each of the sub-directories, create three more sub-directories named \"Project1\", \"Project2\", and \"Project3\".\n\nSubmit your answer as the total number of directories created, including the main directory.\nAssistant: bash_action({\"script\": \"mkdir -p ~/StudentFiles/{ClassA,ClassB,ClassC}/{Project1,Project2,Project3} && find ~/StudentFiles -type d | wc -l\"})\nTool: The output of the OS:\n\n13\r\n\nAssistant: answer_action({\"answer\": \"13\"})\n\n\nQuestion: Now, I will start a new problem in a new OS. My problem is:\n\nAs a student, you need to find out the total number of unique file types (based on their extensions) in a given directory called `problem_directory` and its subdirectories in your Linux (Ubuntu) operating system. The answer should be an integer representing the total count of unique file types. Please note: 1. Only consider files with extensions and ignore files without extensions. 2. File extensions are case-insensitive (e.g., .txt and .TXT are the same type). 3. Do not include directories in the count.\nAssistant: bash_action({\"script\": \"find problem_directory -type f -name \\\\\"*.*\\\\\" | awk -F. '{print $NF}' | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | sort | uniq | wc -l\"})\nTool: The output of the OS:\n\n4\r\n\nAssistant: answer_action({\"answer\": \"4\"})"
