I will play the role of a Linux (Ubuntu) operating system.\nYour goal is to implement the operations required by me or answer the questions proposed by me.\nFor each of your turns, you should first think about what you should do, and then call exactly one of the provided tools according to the situation.\nIf you think the output is too long, I will truncate it. The truncated output is not complete. You have to deal with the truncating problem by yourself.\nAttention, your bash code should not contain any input operation. Once again, you should use one tool in each turn, and should not respond without function calling.\nNote that if you think the task has been finished, or there is some message missing to completely complete the task, you should respond with calling the function \"finish_action\", as no additional information will be provided.\nAlso, note that if you have gotten the answer to the question, you should call the \"answer_action\" tool instead of simply writing your answer in your response.\nYour answers should be exact and precise (for example, a single number), do not answer with full sentences or phrases.\nAlways use a tool provided instead of simply responding with content."

You have to navigate to the 'files' folder and find the total sum of all the integers present across all the text files. Integers can be positive or negative and may be more than one per line. The integers are separated by whitespace or special characters. \"\n\nHere are some examples of the task you have completed:\n\nQuestion: Now, I will start a new problem in a new OS. My problem is:\n\nAs a student, you are given a directory located at `/tmp/experiment/` containing multiple subdirectories. Each subdirectory contains an unknown number of text files. Your task is to find out the total number of lines across all the text files in all the subdirectories. To achieve this, you will have to write a Linux command that will output this total number of lines.\nAssistant: bash_action({\"script\": \"find /tmp/experiment/ -type f -exec wc -l {} + | awk '{sum += $1} END {print sum}'\"})\nTool: The output of the OS:\n\n14\r\n\nAssistant: answer_action({\"answer\": \"14\"})\n\n\nQuestion: Now, I will start a new problem in a new OS. My problem is:\n\nAs a student, you are required to find the total number of regular files and directories inside a given folder (including sub-directories). The folder will be located in the home directory, named \"exp_folder\". You should write a bash script to count the number of regular files and directories separately and then output the sum of them.\nAssistant: bash_action({\"script\": \"find ~/exp_folder -type f | wc -l && find ~/exp_folder -type d | wc -l\"})\nTool: The output of the OS:\n\n5\r\n3\r\n\nAssistant: answer_action({\"answer\": \"8\"})\n\n\nQuestion: Now, I will start a new problem in a new OS. My problem is:\n\nYour task is to calculate the total size of all files in a given directory, including files in its subdirectories, and return the total size in bytes. The given directory is `/home/user/experiment` which contains multiple subdirectories and files of different sizes.\n\nNOTE: You should not use any pre-built tools or commands to return the total directory size directly (e.g., `du`). You are required to find the size of each file individually and calculate the total sum. The answer must be an integer.\nAssistant: bash_action({\"script\": \"find /home/user/experiment -type f -exec stat -c %s {} + | awk '{sum += $1} END {print sum}'\"})\nTool: The output of the OS:\n\n94\r\n\nAssistant: answer_action({\"answer\": \"94\"})\n\n\nQuestion: Now, I will start a new problem in a new OS. My problem is:\n\nAs a student, you need to find out the total number of unique file types (based on their extensions) in a given directory called `problem_directory` and its subdirectories in your Linux (Ubuntu) operating system. The answer should be an integer representing the total count of unique file types. Please note: 1. Only consider files with extensions and ignore files without extensions. 2. File extensions are case-insensitive (e.g., .txt and .TXT are the same type). 3. Do not include directories in the count.\nAssistant: bash_action({\"script\": \"find problem_directory -type f -name \\\\\"*.*\\\\\" | awk -F. '{print $NF}' | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | sort | uniq | wc -l\"})\nTool: The output of the OS:\n\n4\r\n\nAssistant: answer_action({\"answer\": \"4\"})"
