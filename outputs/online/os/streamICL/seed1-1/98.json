I will play the role of a Linux (Ubuntu) operating system.\nYour goal is to implement the operations required by me or answer the questions proposed by me.\nFor each of your turns, you should first think about what you should do, and then call exactly one of the provided tools according to the situation.\nIf you think the output is too long, I will truncate it. The truncated output is not complete. You have to deal with the truncating problem by yourself.\nAttention, your bash code should not contain any input operation. Once again, you should use one tool in each turn, and should not respond without function calling.\nNote that if you think the task has been finished, or there is some message missing to completely complete the task, you should respond with calling the function \"finish_action\", as no additional information will be provided.\nAlso, note that if you have gotten the answer to the question, you should call the \"answer_action\" tool instead of simply writing your answer in your response.\nYour answers should be exact and precise (for example, a single number), do not answer with full sentences or phrases.\nAlways use a tool provided instead of simply responding with content."

My problem is:\n\nAs a student, you need to determine the total occupied storage space by all the `.txt` files in a given directory to understand how much storage the text files are consuming. You will be given a directory named \"files_directory\" with several files of various extensions. Your task is to calculate the total size in kilobytes (KB) of all `.txt` files in the \"files_directory\" directory and return the result as an integer.\n\nHere are some examples of the task you have completed:\n\nQuestion: Now, I will start a new problem in a new OS. My problem is:\n\nYour task is to calculate the total size of all files in a given directory, including files in its subdirectories, and return the total size in bytes. The given directory is `/home/user/experiment` which contains multiple subdirectories and files of different sizes.\n\nNOTE: You should not use any pre-built tools or commands to return the total directory size directly (e.g., `du`). You are required to find the size of each file individually and calculate the total sum. The answer must be an integer.\nAssistant: bash_action({\"script\": \"find /home/user/experiment -type f -exec stat -c %s {} + | awk '{sum += $1} END {print sum}'\"})\nTool: The output of the OS:\n\n94\r\n\nAssistant: answer_action({\"answer\": \"94\"})\n\n\nQuestion: Now, I will start a new problem in a new OS. My problem is:\n\nAs a student, you have been assigned a task to analyze the files in a directory and provide useful statistics. Your goal is to determine the total number of lines contained in all the \".txt\" files in the \"/home/student/files\" directory and its subdirectories.\n\nPlease provide your answer in the form of an integer, representing the sum of lines present in all \".txt\" files.\nAssistant: bash_action({\"script\": \"find /home/student/files -type f -name \\\\\"*.txt\\\\\" -exec wc -l {} + | awk '{sum += $1} END {print sum}'\"})\nTool: The output of the OS:\n\n6\r\n\nAssistant: answer_action({\"answer\": \"6\"})\n\n\nQuestion: Now, I will start a new problem in a new OS. My problem is:\n\n\"As a student, you are required to calculate the total size of all regular files within a specific directory, 'sample_directory', in bytes. The directory will be created by the initialization script and it will contain several files and subdirectories; however, you should only consider regular files present in the main directory, and ignore files inside subdirectories. Create a bash script to calculate the sum of sizes of the regular files in the given directory, 'sample_directory'. The script should output a single integer representing the total size.\"\nAssistant: bash_action({\"script\": \"find sample_directory -maxdepth 1 -type f -exec stat -c %s {} + | awk '{sum += $1} END {print sum}'\"})\nTool: The output of the OS:\n\n101\r\n\nAssistant: answer_action({\"answer\": \"101\"})\n\n\nQuestion: Now, I will start a new problem in a new OS. My problem is:\n\nAs a student, you are requested to find out the total number of lines containing a specific word in all the \".txt\" files within a given directory. You will be given the word \"Linux\" and a directory named \"files-dir\" containing some \".txt\" files with random content. The output should be a single integer representing the total count of lines containing the word \"Linux\" in all the \".txt\" files.\nAssistant: bash_action({\"script\": \"find files-dir -type f -name \\\\\"*.txt\\\\\" -exec grep -i -o 'Linux' {} \\\\\\\\; | wc -l\"})\nTool: The output of the OS:\n\n5\r\n\nAssistant: answer_action({\"answer\": \"5\"})"
