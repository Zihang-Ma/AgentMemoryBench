The truncated output is not complete. You have to deal with the truncating problem by yourself.\nAttention, your bash code should not contain any input operation. Once again, you should use one tool in each turn, and should not respond without function calling.\nNote that if you think the task has been finished, or there is some message missing to completely complete the task, you should respond with calling the function \"finish_action\", as no additional information will be provided.\nAlso, note that if you have gotten the answer to the question, you should call the \"answer_action\" tool instead of simply writing your answer in your response.\nYour answers should be exact and precise (for example, a single number), do not answer with full sentences or phrases.\nAlways use a tool provided instead of simply responding with content."

My problem is:\n\nIn this problem, you will write a bash script that reads a text file containing a list of file names, one name per line. The text file will be placed in a newly created directory named \"files_list.\" The script should fetch the total number of lines containing a specified file extension (e.g., \".txt\"). You may assume that file names are alphanumeric, and the file extension will have a period followed by 3 lowercase letters. You should ensure that your script operates within the \"files_list\" directory to successfully complete the tasks pointed out in the problem.\n\nHere are some examples of the task you have completed:\n\nQuestion: Now, I will start a new problem in a new OS. My problem is:\n\nAs a student, you are given a directory located at ~/student_directory that contains several subdirectories. Each subdirectory contains a few text files. Your task is to find the total number of lines in all text files (.txt) combined, and submit it as the answer. It is crucial to ensure you only count the lines from text files (.txt) in the specified directory and subdirectories, and ignore other file types. Use the built-in Linux commands to achieve this.\nAssistant: bash_action({\"script\": \"find ~/student_directory -type f -name \\\\\\\\\"*.txt\\\\\\\\\" -exec wc -l {} \\\\\\\\; | awk '{sum += $1} END {print sum}'\"})\nTool: Expecting ',' delimiter: line 1 column 55 (char 54)\nAssistant: bash_action({\"script\": \"find ~/student_directory -type f -name \\\\\\\\\"*.txt\\\\\\\\\" | wc -l\"})\nTool: Expecting ',' delimiter: line 1 column 55 (char 54)\nAssistant: bash_action({\"script\": \"find ~/student_directory -type f -name \\\\\"*.txt\\\\\" | wc -l\"})\nTool: The output of the OS:\n\n5\r\n\nAssistant: answer_action({\"answer\": \"5\"})\nUser: No executable tool calls found.

Note that the \"/home/user/documents\" directory could be arbitrarily nested with subdirectories containing no limit to the number of files or other directories.\n\nThe output should be a single integer (the total count of files with the given extension).\nAssistant: bash_action({\"script\": \"find /home/user/documents -type f -name \\\\\\\\\"*.txt\\\\\\\\\" | wc -l\"})\nTool: Expecting ',' delimiter: line 1 column 56 (char 55)\nAssistant: bash_action({\"script\": \"find /home/user/documents -type f -name \\\\\"*.txt\\\\\" | wc -l\"})\nTool: The output of the OS:\n\n6\r\n\nAssistant: answer_action({\"answer\": \"6\"})"
