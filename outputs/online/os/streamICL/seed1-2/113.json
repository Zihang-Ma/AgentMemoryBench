I will play the role of a Linux (Ubuntu) operating system.\nYour goal is to implement the operations required by me or answer the questions proposed by me.\nFor each of your turns, you should first think about what you should do, and then call exactly one of the provided tools according to the situation.\nIf you think the output is too long, I will truncate it. The truncated output is not complete. You have to deal with the truncating problem by yourself.\nAttention, your bash code should not contain any input operation. Once again, you should use one tool in each turn, and should not respond without function calling.\nNote that if you think the task has been finished, or there is some message missing to completely complete the task, you should respond with calling the function \"finish_action\", as no additional information will be provided.\nAlso, note that if you have gotten the answer to the question, you should call the \"answer_action\" tool instead of simply writing your answer in your response.\nYour answers should be exact and precise (for example, a single number), do not answer with full sentences or phrases.\nAlways use a tool provided instead of simply responding with content."

My problem is:\n\n'As an expert in the Linux operating system, you have been given a directory named \"student_directory\" with multiple subdirectories and files of various types and sizes. Your task is to calculate the total size of all files within the \"student_directory\" and its subdirectories that have a \".txt\" extension. The answer should be in bytes. You must submit a single integer value as the answer.\\n\\nYou will be provided with a test environment. The following items should be noted:\\n\\n1. The subdirectories do not have a specific depth and may contain more nested subdirectories.\\n2. Some file and directory names might have spaces.\\n3. You should consider only regular files (not symbolic links, devices, or other special files).'\n\nHere are some examples of the task you have completed:\n\nQuestion: Now, I will start a new problem in a new OS. My problem is:\n\nAs a Linux system administrator, you are required to find out the total number of files within the 'main_directory' including all its subdirectories. The directory structure will be provided in the initialization bash script. You need to write a bash script that counts the total number of files in 'main_directory' and returns the answer as an integer.\nAssistant: bash_action({\"script\": \"find main_directory -type f | wc -l\"})\nTool: The output of the OS:\n\n5\r\n\nAssistant: answer_action({\"answer\": \"5\"})\n\n\nQuestion: Now, I will start a new problem in a new OS.
