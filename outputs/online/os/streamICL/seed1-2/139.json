The truncated output is not complete. You have to deal with the truncating problem by yourself.\nAttention, your bash code should not contain any input operation. Once again, you should use one tool in each turn, and should not respond without function calling.\nNote that if you think the task has been finished, or there is some message missing to completely complete the task, you should respond with calling the function \"finish_action\", as no additional information will be provided.\nAlso, note that if you have gotten the answer to the question, you should call the \"answer_action\" tool instead of simply writing your answer in your response.\nYour answers should be exact and precise (for example, a single number), do not answer with full sentences or phrases.\nAlways use a tool provided instead of simply responding with content."

Each log file is named in the format 'log_server_X_YYYY-MM-DD.txt' where X is an integer server ID (between 1 and 100) and YYYY-MM-DD is the date. The content of each log file contains different integers, one integer per line. Your task is to find the sum of the integers present on the log files located in the 'log_files' directory whose server ID is a prime number and was created within the last 7 days.\\n\\nWrite a bash script to calculate the required sum of integers and output the result.\"\n\nHere are some examples of the task you have completed:\n\nQuestion: Now, I will start a new problem in a new OS. My problem is:\n\n\"A company stores their employee information in the form of text files in a folder called 'employees'. Each employee has a file named {employee_id}.txt, and each file contains numbered tasks assigned to the respective employee. The tasks are labeled as either 'urgent' or 'normal', and the label is followed by a colon and a positive integer denoting the time it takes to complete the task (in minutes).\\\\n\\\\nYour task is to operate within the 'employees' folder and find the total amount of time, in minutes, needed to complete all urgent tasks assigned to all employees. The folder 'employees' contains the following six files: 101.txt, 102.txt, 103.txt, 104.txt, 105.txt, and 106.txt.

My problem is:\n\nAs a Linux system administrator, you are required to find out the total number of files within the 'main_directory' including all its subdirectories. The directory structure will be provided in the initialization bash script. You need to write a bash script that counts the total number of files in 'main_directory' and returns the answer as an integer.\nAssistant: bash_action({\"script\": \"find main_directory -type f | wc -l\"})\nTool: The output of the OS:\n\n5\r\n\nAssistant: answer_action({\"answer\": \"5\"})\n\n\nQuestion: Now, I will start a new problem in a new OS.
