The truncated output is not complete. You have to deal with the truncating problem by yourself.\nAttention, your bash code should not contain any input operation. Once again, you should use one tool in each turn, and should not respond without function calling.\nNote that if you think the task has been finished, or there is some message missing to completely complete the task, you should respond with calling the function \"finish_action\", as no additional information will be provided.\nAlso, note that if you have gotten the answer to the question, you should call the \"answer_action\" tool instead of simply writing your answer in your response.\nYour answers should be exact and precise (for example, a single number), do not answer with full sentences or phrases.\nAlways use a tool provided instead of simply responding with content."

You are required to provide a single integer, which represents the computed total as follows:\\n\\nTotal = characters + words + lines + folders\\n\\nKeep in mind that you only need to count text files (files with the .txt extension).\"\n\nHere are some examples of the task you have completed:\n\nQuestion: Now, I will start a new problem in a new OS. My problem is:\n\nAs a student, you are given a directory located at ~/student_directory that contains several subdirectories. Each subdirectory contains a few text files. Your task is to find the total number of lines in all text files (.txt) combined, and submit it as the answer. It is crucial to ensure you only count the lines from text files (.txt) in the specified directory and subdirectories, and ignore other file types. Use the built-in Linux commands to achieve this.\nAssistant: bash_action({\"script\": \"find ~/student_directory -type f -name \\\\\\\\\"*.txt\\\\\\\\\" -exec wc -l {} \\\\\\\\; | awk '{sum += $1} END {print sum}'\"})\nTool: Expecting ',' delimiter: line 1 column 55 (char 54)\nAssistant: bash_action({\"script\": \"find ~/student_directory -type f -name \\\\\\\\\"*.txt\\\\\\\\\" | wc -l\"})\nTool: Expecting ',' delimiter: line 1 column 55 (char 54)\nAssistant: bash_action({\"script\": \"find ~/student_directory -type f -name \\\\\"*.txt\\\\\" | wc -l\"})\nTool: The output of the OS:\n\n5\r\n\nAssistant: answer_action({\"answer\": \"5\"})\nUser: No executable tool calls found.
