I will play the role of a Linux (Ubuntu) operating system.\nYour goal is to implement the operations required by me or answer the questions proposed by me.\nFor each of your turns, you should first think about what you should do, and then call exactly one of the provided tools according to the situation.\nIf you think the output is too long, I will truncate it. The truncated output is not complete. You have to deal with the truncating problem by yourself.\nAttention, your bash code should not contain any input operation. Once again, you should use one tool in each turn, and should not respond without function calling.\nNote that if you think the task has been finished, or there is some message missing to completely complete the task, you should respond with calling the function \"finish_action\", as no additional information will be provided.\nAlso, note that if you have gotten the answer to the question, you should call the \"answer_action\" tool instead of simply writing your answer in your response.\nYour answers should be exact and precise (for example, a single number), do not answer with full sentences or phrases.\nAlways use a tool provided instead of simply responding with content."

My problem is:\n\n'You are given a directory named \"files\" within your current working directory, which contains a variable number of text files. Each text file contains a single line of comma-separated integers. Your task is to compute the sum of all integers in each file, and then find the highest sum among all the files in the directory.\\n\\nFirst, execute an initialization bash script to deploy the environment required for the problem. After executing the script, you will find a directory named \"files\" directly under your current working directory containing multiple text files.\\n\\nYour job is to interact with the shell to calculate the sum of integers in each file inside the \"files\" directory and find the highest sum. When you think you have an answer, submit the highest sum as an integer.'\n\nHere are some examples of the task you have completed:\n\nQuestion: Now, I will start a new problem in a new OS. My problem is:\n\nAs a Linux system administrator, you are required to find out the total number of files within the 'main_directory' including all its subdirectories. The directory structure will be provided in the initialization bash script. You need to write a bash script that counts the total number of files in 'main_directory' and returns the answer as an integer.\nAssistant: bash_action({\"script\": \"find main_directory -type f | wc -l\"})\nTool: The output of the OS:\n\n5\r\n\nAssistant: answer_action({\"answer\": \"5\"})\n\n\nQuestion: Now, I will start a new problem in a new OS. My problem is:\n\n\"A company stores their employee information in the form of text files in a folder called 'employees'. Each employee has a file named {employee_id}.txt, and each file contains numbered tasks assigned to the respective employee. The tasks are labeled as either 'urgent' or 'normal', and the label is followed by a colon and a positive integer denoting the time it takes to complete the task (in minutes).\\\\n\\\\nYour task is to operate within the 'employees' folder and find the total amount of time, in minutes, needed to complete all urgent tasks assigned to all employees. The folder 'employees' contains the following six files: 101.txt, 102.txt, 103.txt, 104.txt, 105.txt, and 106.txt. The final result should be a single integer, which is the sum of urgent task times.\\\\n\\\\nExample of task list in an employee's file:\\\\n```\\\\nurgent:30\\\\nnormal:10\\\\nurgent:20\\\\nnormal:15\\\\n```\"\nAssistant: bash_action({\"script\": \"cd employees && find . -type f -name \\\\\\\\\"*.txt\\\\\\\\\" -exec grep -E \\\\\\\\\"urgent:[0-9]+\\\\\\\\\\\\\" {} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\; | awk -F: '{sum += $2} END {print sum}'\"})\nTool: Expecting ',' delimiter: line 1 column 53 (char 52)\nAssistant: bash_action({\"script\": \"find employees -type f -name \\\\\"*.txt\\\\\" -exec grep -E \\\\\"urgent:[0-9]+\\\\\" {} \\\\\\\\; | awk -F: '{sum += $2} END {print sum}'\"})\nTool: The output of the OS:\n\n230\r\n\nAssistant: answer_action({\"answer\": \"230\"})\nUser: No executable tool calls found.

My problem is:\n\nAs a student, you are requested to find the total number of files and directories inside a specific directory, including its subdirectories. The output should be an integer representing the total count without any extra information. The given directory will be named \"project_directory\".\nAssistant: bash_action({\"script\": \"find project_directory -type f -o -type d | wc -l\"})\nTool: The output of the OS:\n\n14\r\n\nAssistant: answer_action({\"answer\": \"14\"})\nUser: No executable tool calls found.

My problem is:\n\n'As a student, you are required to find the total number of lines containing the word \"Linux\" in all text files (*.txt) within a specific directory named \"linux_problem\" and its subdirectories. You are given the path to the directory as an input.
