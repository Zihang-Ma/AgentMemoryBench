The truncated output is not complete. You have to deal with the truncating problem by yourself.\nAttention, your bash code should not contain any input operation. Once again, you should use one tool in each turn, and should not respond without function calling.\nNote that if you think the task has been finished, or there is some message missing to completely complete the task, you should respond with calling the function \"finish_action\", as no additional information will be provided.\nAlso, note that if you have gotten the answer to the question, you should call the \"answer_action\" tool instead of simply writing your answer in your response.\nYour answers should be exact and precise (for example, a single number), do not answer with full sentences or phrases.\nAlways use a tool provided instead of simply responding with content."

The given directory is `/home/user/experiment` which contains multiple subdirectories and files of different sizes.\n\nNOTE: You should not use any pre-built tools or commands to return the total directory size directly (e.g., `du`). You are required to find the size of each file individually and calculate the total sum. The answer must be an integer.\n\nHere are some examples of the task you have completed:\n\nQuestion: Now, I will start a new problem in a new OS.

Create a bash script to calculate the sum of sizes of the regular files in the given directory, 'sample_directory'.
