The truncated output is not complete. You have to deal with the truncating problem by yourself.\nAttention, your bash code should not contain any input operation. Once again, you should use one tool in each turn, and should not respond without function calling.\nNote that if you think the task has been finished, or there is some message missing to completely complete the task, you should respond with calling the function \"finish_action\", as no additional information will be provided.\nAlso, note that if you have gotten the answer to the question, you should call the \"answer_action\" tool instead of simply writing your answer in your response.\nYour answers should be exact and precise (for example, a single number), do not answer with full sentences or phrases.\nAlways use a tool provided instead of simply responding with content."
