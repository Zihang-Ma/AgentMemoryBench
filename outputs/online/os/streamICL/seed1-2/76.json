The truncated output is not complete. You have to deal with the truncating problem by yourself.\nAttention, your bash code should not contain any input operation. Once again, you should use one tool in each turn, and should not respond without function calling.\nNote that if you think the task has been finished, or there is some message missing to completely complete the task, you should respond with calling the function \"finish_action\", as no additional information will be provided.\nAlso, note that if you have gotten the answer to the question, you should call the \"answer_action\" tool instead of simply writing your answer in your response.\nYour answers should be exact and precise (for example, a single number), do not answer with full sentences or phrases.\nAlways use a tool provided instead of simply responding with content."

The filename format is \"log_YYYY-MM-DD.txt\". Your task is to count the occurrences of the word \"error\" (case insensitive) in the log files and sum the errors in all log files.\n\nTo complete this task, perform the following steps:\n\n1. Create a directory named \"logs\".\n2. Create log files for the past 7 days inside the \"logs\" directory. The content of each log file should have random \"error\"/\"Error\" entries along with other content.\n3. Use Linux command(s) to calculate the total count of \"error\" (case insensitive) occurrences in all the log files inside the \"logs\" directory.\n\nYour final answer should be the total count of \"error\" occurrences as an integer.\n\nHere are some examples of the task you have completed:\n\nQuestion: Now, I will start a new problem in a new OS.

Your answer should be the total number of occurrences of the word \"Linux\" across all the text files in the entire directory structure (including subdirectories). Make sure you only count exact matches and that the word is treated as case-sensitive.\nAssistant: bash_action({\"script\": \"find problem_directory -type f -name \\\\\\\\\"*.txt\\\\\\\\\" -exec grep -c \\\\\\\\\"Linux\\\\\\\\\" {} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\; | awk '{sum += $1} END {print sum}'\"})\nTool: Expecting ',' delimiter: line 1 column 53 (char 52)\nAssistant: bash_action({\"script\": \"find problem_directory -type f -name \\\\\\\\\"*.txt\\\\\\\\\" -exec grep -c \\\\\\\\\"Linux\\\\\\\\\" {} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\; | awk '{sum += $1} END {print sum}'\"})\nTool: Expecting ',' delimiter: line 1 column 53 (char 52)\nAssistant: bash_action({\"script\": \"find problem_directory -type f -name \\\\\\\\\"*.txt\\\\\\\\\" -exec grep -o \\\\\\\\\"Linux\\\\\\\\\" {} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\; | wc -l\"})\nTool: Expecting ',' delimiter: line 1 column 53 (char 52)\nAssistant: bash_action({\"script\": \"find problem_directory -type f -name \\\\\\\\\"*.txt\\\\\\\\\" -exec grep -o \\\\\\\\\"Linux\\\\\\\\\" {} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\; | wc -l\"})\nTool: Expecting ',' delimiter: line 1 column 53 (char 52)\nAssistant: bash_action({\"script\": \"find problem_directory -type f -name \\\\\\\\\"*.txt\\\\\\\\\" -exec grep -o \\\\\\\\\"Linux\\\\\\\\\" {} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\; | wc -l\"})\nTool: Expecting ',' delimiter: line 1 column 53 (char 52)\nAssistant: bash_action({\"script\": \"find problem_directory -type f -exec grep -c \\\\\"Linux\\\\\" {} \\\\\\\\; | awk '{sum += $1} END {print sum}'\"})\nTool: The output of the OS:\n\n6\r\n\nAssistant: answer_action({\"answer\": \"6\"})\n\n\nQuestion: Now, I will start a new problem in a new OS.

The log files are named as \"server1.log\", \"server2.log\", etc. Each log file contains a list of errors observed on that server.\n\nThe error messages have a specific format: a timestamp followed by an error code and error message, separated by colons. For example:\n\n```\n2022-02-28T10:30:23Z:ERR0001:Permission denied.\n2022-02-28T10:31:42Z:ERR0003:Failed to connect to the database.\n```\n\nYour task is to calculate the total number of errors with the error code 'ERR0003' found in all log files present in the `log_files` directory. \n\nThe answer must be an integer representing the total count of the 'ERR0003' error code in all log files.\nAssistant: bash_action({\"script\": \"cd log_files && find . -type f -name \\\\\\\\\"*.log\\\\\\\\\" -exec grep -c \\\\\\\\\"ERR0003\\\\\\\\\" {} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\; | awk '{sum += $1} END {print sum}'\"})\nTool: Expecting ',' delimiter: line 1 column 53 (char 52)\nAssistant: bash_action({\"script\": \"find log_files -type f -name \\\\\"*.log\\\\\" -exec grep -c \\\\\"ERR0003\\\\\" {} \\\\\\\\; | awk '{sum += $1} END {print sum}'\"})\nTool: The output of the OS:\n\n3\r\n\nAssistant: answer_action({\"answer\": \"3\"})\n\n\nQuestion: Now, I will start a new problem in a new OS.
