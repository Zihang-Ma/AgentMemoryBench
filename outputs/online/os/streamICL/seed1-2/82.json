The truncated output is not complete. You have to deal with the truncating problem by yourself.\nAttention, your bash code should not contain any input operation. Once again, you should use one tool in each turn, and should not respond without function calling.\nNote that if you think the task has been finished, or there is some message missing to completely complete the task, you should respond with calling the function \"finish_action\", as no additional information will be provided.\nAlso, note that if you have gotten the answer to the question, you should call the \"answer_action\" tool instead of simply writing your answer in your response.\nYour answers should be exact and precise (for example, a single number), do not answer with full sentences or phrases.\nAlways use a tool provided instead of simply responding with content."

My problem is:\n\nAs a student, you are tasked to retrieve the number of lines of code in Python files within a specific directory and all its subdirectories. The directory, named `question_directory`, has been provided to you by the initialization script and contains numerous Python files with the extension `.py`. Your task is to find the total number of lines of code across all the Python files contained in the `question_directory` and all its subdirectories. Note: Ignore any empty lines. Only count lines with actual code.\n\nHere are some examples of the task you have completed:\n\nQuestion: Now, I will start a new problem in a new OS. My problem is:\n\n'In this task, you are required to calculate the total number of lines of code (LOC) written in Python (.py) files in a given directory named \"codebase\" and its subdirectories. The directory will be created and populated through the initialization script and will contain several Python files and subdirectories with Python files. Note that the directory and file structure may change with each new experiment. Your task is to interact with the Linux shell and find the total LOC in all Python files within the \"codebase\" directory and its subdirectories.'\nAssistant: bash_action({\"script\": \"find codebase -type f -name \\\\\\\\\"*.py\\\\\\\\\" -exec wc -l {} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\; | awk '{sum += $1} END {print sum}'\"})\nTool: Expecting ',' delimiter: line 1 column 44 (char 43)\nAssistant: bash_action({\"script\": \"find codebase -type f -name \\\\\"*.py\\\\\" -exec wc -l {} \\\\\\\\; | awk '{sum += $1} END {print sum}'\"})\nTool: The output of the OS:\n\n4\r\n\nAssistant: answer_action({\"answer\": \"4\"})\n\n\nQuestion: Now, I will start a new problem in a new OS. My problem is:\n\nAs a student, your task is to determine how many lines of code (LOC) are written in the C programming language within the \"code_directory\" directory structure. This directory structure contains multiple subdirectories and files with different programming languages. You need to count the number of lines in all .c files present in the \"code_directory\" directory and its subdirectories; your answer must be an integer.

My problem is:\n\nAs a student, you are given a directory located at ~/student_directory that contains several subdirectories. Each subdirectory contains a few text files. Your task is to find the total number of lines in all text files (.txt) combined, and submit it as the answer. It is crucial to ensure you only count the lines from text files (.txt) in the specified directory and subdirectories, and ignore other file types. Use the built-in Linux commands to achieve this.\nAssistant: bash_action({\"script\": \"find ~/student_directory -type f -name \\\\\\\\\"*.txt\\\\\\\\\" -exec wc -l {} \\\\\\\\; | awk '{sum += $1} END {print sum}'\"})\nTool: Expecting ',' delimiter: line 1 column 55 (char 54)\nAssistant: bash_action({\"script\": \"find ~/student_directory -type f -name \\\\\\\\\"*.txt\\\\\\\\\" | wc -l\"})\nTool: Expecting ',' delimiter: line 1 column 55 (char 54)\nAssistant: bash_action({\"script\": \"find ~/student_directory -type f -name \\\\\"*.txt\\\\\" | wc -l\"})\nTool: The output of the OS:\n\n5\r\n\nAssistant: answer_action({\"answer\": \"5\"})\nUser: No executable tool calls found.

My problem is:\n\nAs a student, you are requested to find the total number of files and directories inside a specific directory, including its subdirectories.
