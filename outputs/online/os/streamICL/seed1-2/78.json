I will play the role of a Linux (Ubuntu) operating system.\nYour goal is to implement the operations required by me or answer the questions proposed by me.\nFor each of your turns, you should first think about what you should do, and then call exactly one of the provided tools according to the situation.\nIf you think the output is too long, I will truncate it. The truncated output is not complete. You have to deal with the truncating problem by yourself.\nAttention, your bash code should not contain any input operation. Once again, you should use one tool in each turn, and should not respond without function calling.\nNote that if you think the task has been finished, or there is some message missing to completely complete the task, you should respond with calling the function \"finish_action\", as no additional information will be provided.\nAlso, note that if you have gotten the answer to the question, you should call the \"answer_action\" tool instead of simply writing your answer in your response.\nYour answers should be exact and precise (for example, a single number), do not answer with full sentences or phrases.\nAlways use a tool provided instead of simply responding with content."

My problem is:\n\nIn this problem, you are asked to calculate the total size (in kilobytes) of all regular files in a given directory in your Ubuntu operating system. The directory will be named 'test_directory' and will be located in the home folder. The directory will contain multiple regular files and subdirectories. You only have to calculate the size of regular files in the \"test_directory\" and ignore the files inside subdirectories.\n\nTo summarize, you must perform the following tasks:\n\n1. Navigate to the 'test_directory' located in your home folder.\n2. Calculate the total size (in kilobytes) of all regular files in the 'test_directory' (ignoring the files inside subdirectories).\n\nHere are some examples of the task you have completed:\n\nQuestion: Now, I will start a new problem in a new OS. My problem is:\n\nAs a student, you are requested to find the total number of files and directories inside a specific directory, including its subdirectories.

You are given the path to the directory as an input. Your answer should only contain an integer, representing the total number of lines containing the word \"Linux\".'\nAssistant: bash_action({\"script\": \"find linux_problem -type f -name \\\\\"*.txt\\\\\" -exec grep -c \\\\\"Linux\\\\\" {} \\\\\\\\; | awk '{sum += $1} END {print sum}'\"})\nTool: The output of the OS:\n\n7\r\n\nAssistant: answer_action({\"answer\": \"7\"})\n\n\nQuestion: Now, I will start a new problem in a new OS. My problem is:\n\n\"A company stores their employee information in the form of text files in a folder called 'employees'. Each employee has a file named {employee_id}.txt, and each file contains numbered tasks assigned to the respective employee. The tasks are labeled as either 'urgent' or 'normal', and the label is followed by a colon and a positive integer denoting the time it takes to complete the task (in minutes).\\\\n\\\\nYour task is to operate within the 'employees' folder and find the total amount of time, in minutes, needed to complete all urgent tasks assigned to all employees. The folder 'employees' contains the following six files: 101.txt, 102.txt, 103.txt, 104.txt, 105.txt, and 106.txt. The final result should be a single integer, which is the sum of urgent task times.\\\\n\\\\nExample of task list in an employee's file:\\\\n```\\\\nurgent:30\\\\nnormal:10\\\\nurgent:20\\\\nnormal:15\\\\n```\"\nAssistant: bash_action({\"script\": \"cd employees && find . -type f -name \\\\\\\\\"*.txt\\\\\\\\\" -exec grep -E \\\\\\\\\"urgent:[0-9]+\\\\\\\\\\\\\" {} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\; | awk -F: '{sum += $2} END {print sum}'\"})\nTool: Expecting ',' delimiter: line 1 column 53 (char 52)\nAssistant: bash_action({\"script\": \"find employees -type f -name \\\\\"*.txt\\\\\" -exec grep -E \\\\\"urgent:[0-9]+\\\\\" {} \\\\\\\\; | awk -F: '{sum += $2} END {print sum}'\"})\nTool: The output of the OS:\n\n230\r\n\nAssistant: answer_action({\"answer\": \"230\"})\nUser: No executable tool calls found.

My problem is:\n\nAs a student, your task is to determine how many lines of code (LOC) are written in the C programming language within the \"code_directory\" directory structure. This directory structure contains multiple subdirectories and files with different programming languages. You need to count the number of lines in all .c files present in the \"code_directory\" directory and its subdirectories; your answer must be an integer. Note: You are only allowed to use the Linux command line and its utilities; you cannot use any other scripts or software to perform this task.\nAssistant: bash_action({\"script\": \"find code_directory -type f -name \\\\\"*.c\\\\\" -exec wc -l {} \\\\\\\\; | awk '{sum += $1} END {print sum}'\"})\nTool: The output of the OS:\n\n6\r\n\nAssistant: answer_action({\"answer\": \"6\"})"
