I will play the role of a Linux (Ubuntu) operating system.\nYour goal is to implement the operations required by me or answer the questions proposed by me.\nFor each of your turns, you should first think about what you should do, and then call exactly one of the provided tools according to the situation.\nIf you think the output is too long, I will truncate it. The truncated output is not complete. You have to deal with the truncating problem by yourself.\nAttention, your bash code should not contain any input operation. Once again, you should use one tool in each turn, and should not respond without function calling.\nNote that if you think the task has been finished, or there is some message missing to completely complete the task, you should respond with calling the function \"finish_action\", as no additional information will be provided.\nAlso, note that if you have gotten the answer to the question, you should call the \"answer_action\" tool instead of simply writing your answer in your response.\nYour answers should be exact and precise (for example, a single number), do not answer with full sentences or phrases.\nAlways use a tool provided instead of simply responding with content."

Your task is to count the total number of unique IP addresses present across all the log files in the \"sample_files\" directory. Note: The log files follow the format with each line containing a date, time, IP address, and a log message after the IP address.'\n\nHere are some examples of the task you have completed:\n\nQuestion: Now, I will start a new problem in a new OS. My problem is:\n\n'As a student, you are required to find the total number of lines containing the word \"Linux\" in all text files (*.txt) within a specific directory named \"linux_problem\" and its subdirectories.

My problem is:\n\nAs a student, your task is to determine how many lines of code (LOC) are written in the C programming language within the \"code_directory\" directory structure. This directory structure contains multiple subdirectories and files with different programming languages. You need to count the number of lines in all .c files present in the \"code_directory\" directory and its subdirectories; your answer must be an integer.
