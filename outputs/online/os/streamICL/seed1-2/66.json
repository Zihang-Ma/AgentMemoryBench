I will play the role of a Linux (Ubuntu) operating system.\nYour goal is to implement the operations required by me or answer the questions proposed by me.\nFor each of your turns, you should first think about what you should do, and then call exactly one of the provided tools according to the situation.\nIf you think the output is too long, I will truncate it. The truncated output is not complete. You have to deal with the truncating problem by yourself.\nAttention, your bash code should not contain any input operation. Once again, you should use one tool in each turn, and should not respond without function calling.\nNote that if you think the task has been finished, or there is some message missing to completely complete the task, you should respond with calling the function \"finish_action\", as no additional information will be provided.\nAlso, note that if you have gotten the answer to the question, you should call the \"answer_action\" tool instead of simply writing your answer in your response.\nYour answers should be exact and precise (for example, a single number), do not answer with full sentences or phrases.\nAlways use a tool provided instead of simply responding with content."

Make sure to consider only '*.txt' files in the current working directory and ignore any files in subdirectories. You should execute this task in the current directory where the init script has created sample files.\"\n\nHere are some examples of the task you have completed:\n\nQuestion: Now, I will start a new problem in a new OS. My problem is:\n\nAs a student, you are given a directory located at ~/student_directory that contains several subdirectories. Each subdirectory contains a few text files. Your task is to find the total number of lines in all text files (.txt) combined, and submit it as the answer. It is crucial to ensure you only count the lines from text files (.txt) in the specified directory and subdirectories, and ignore other file types. Use the built-in Linux commands to achieve this.\nAssistant: bash_action({\"script\": \"find ~/student_directory -type f -name \\\\\\\\\"*.txt\\\\\\\\\" -exec wc -l {} \\\\\\\\; | awk '{sum += $1} END {print sum}'\"})\nTool: Expecting ',' delimiter: line 1 column 55 (char 54)\nAssistant: bash_action({\"script\": \"find ~/student_directory -type f -name \\\\\\\\\"*.txt\\\\\\\\\" | wc -l\"})\nTool: Expecting ',' delimiter: line 1 column 55 (char 54)\nAssistant: bash_action({\"script\": \"find ~/student_directory -type f -name \\\\\"*.txt\\\\\" | wc -l\"})\nTool: The output of the OS:\n\n5\r\n\nAssistant: answer_action({\"answer\": \"5\"})\nUser: No executable tool calls found.

My problem is:\n\n'As a student, you are required to find the total number of lines containing the word \"Linux\" in all text files (*.txt) within a specific directory named \"linux_problem\" and its subdirectories. You are given the path to the directory as an input. Your answer should only contain an integer, representing the total number of lines containing the word \"Linux\".'\nAssistant: bash_action({\"script\": \"find linux_problem -type f -name \\\\\"*.txt\\\\\" -exec grep -c \\\\\"Linux\\\\\" {} \\\\\\\\; | awk '{sum += $1} END {print sum}'\"})\nTool: The output of the OS:\n\n7\r\n\nAssistant: answer_action({\"answer\": \"7\"})\n\n\nQuestion: Now, I will start a new problem in a new OS. My problem is:\n\nAs a student, you are requested to find the total number of files and directories inside a specific directory, including its subdirectories. The output should be an integer representing the total count without any extra information. The given directory will be named \"project_directory\".\nAssistant: bash_action({\"script\": \"find project_directory -type f -o -type d | wc -l\"})\nTool: The output of the OS:\n\n14\r\n\nAssistant: answer_action({\"answer\": \"14\"})\nUser: No executable tool calls found.

My problem is:\n\nIn this problem, the students should calculate the total number of files and directories (recursive) in a given directory. The directory will be created and populated with files and directories by the initialization script. During the initialization, a specific environment variable `TARGET_DIR` will be set pointing to the created directory, which should be used by the students in their command.\n\nYou need to find the total number of files and directories (recursive) in the directory pointed by `TARGET_DIR`.
