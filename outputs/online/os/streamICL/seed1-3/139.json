I will play the role of a Linux (Ubuntu) operating system.\nYour goal is to implement the operations required by me or answer the questions proposed by me.\nFor each of your turns, you should first think about what you should do, and then call exactly one of the provided tools according to the situation.\nIf you think the output is too long, I will truncate it. The truncated output is not complete. You have to deal with the truncating problem by yourself.\nAttention, your bash code should not contain any input operation. Once again, you should use one tool in each turn, and should not respond without function calling.\nNote that if you think the task has been finished, or there is some message missing to completely complete the task, you should respond with calling the function \"finish_action\", as no additional information will be provided.\nAlso, note that if you have gotten the answer to the question, you should call the \"answer_action\" tool instead of simply writing your answer in your response.\nYour answers should be exact and precise (for example, a single number), do not answer with full sentences or phrases.\nAlways use a tool provided instead of simply responding with content."

Each log file is named in the format 'log_server_X_YYYY-MM-DD.txt' where X is an integer server ID (between 1 and 100) and YYYY-MM-DD is the date. The content of each log file contains different integers, one integer per line. Your task is to find the sum of the integers present on the log files located in the 'log_files' directory whose server ID is a prime number and was created within the last 7 days.\\n\\nWrite a bash script to calculate the required sum of integers and output the result.\"\n\nHere are some examples of the task you have completed:\n\nQuestion: Now, I will start a new problem in a new OS. My problem is:\n\n'You are given a directory named \"files\" within your current working directory, which contains a variable number of text files. Each text file contains a single line of comma-separated integers. Your task is to compute the sum of all integers in each file, and then find the highest sum among all the files in the directory.\\\\n\\\\nFirst, execute an initialization bash script to deploy the environment required for the problem. After executing the script, you will find a directory named \"files\" directly under your current working directory containing multiple text files.\\\\n\\\\nYour job is to interact with the shell to calculate the sum of integers in each file inside the \"files\" directory and find the highest sum. When you think you have an answer, submit the highest sum as an integer.'\nAssistant: bash_action({\"script\": \"mkdir -p files && touch files/file1.txt files/file2.txt files/file3.txt && echo '1,2,3' > files/file1.txt && echo '4,5,6' > files/file2.txt && echo '7,8,9' > files/file3.txt\"})\nTool: The output of the OS is empty.\nAssistant: bash_action({\"script\": \"cd files && for file in *.txt; do sum=$(awk -F, '{for(i=1;i<=NF;i++) total += $i} END {print total}' $file); echo $sum; done | sort -nr | head -n1\"})\nTool: The output of the OS:\n\n24\r\n\nAssistant: answer_action({\"answer\": \"24\"})\n\n\nQuestion: Now, I will start a new problem in a new OS.

My problem is:\n\n\"As a student, you are required to calculate the total size of all regular files within a specific directory, 'sample_directory', in bytes. The directory will be created by the initialization script and it will contain several files and subdirectories; however, you should only consider regular files present in the main directory, and ignore files inside subdirectories. Create a bash script to calculate the sum of sizes of the regular files in the given directory, 'sample_directory'. The script should output a single integer representing the total size.\"\nAssistant: bash_action({\"script\": \"find sample_directory -maxdepth 1 -type f -exec stat -c %s {} + | awk '{total += $1} END {print total}'\"})\nTool: The output of the OS:\n\n101\r\n\nAssistant: answer_action({\"answer\": \"101\"})\n\n\nQuestion: Now, I will start a new problem in a new OS. My problem is:\n\nAs a Linux (Ubuntu) user, your task is to create a script that counts the total storage used by all regular files within the \"/var/log\" directory, in kilobytes.
