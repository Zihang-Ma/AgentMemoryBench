I will play the role of a Linux (Ubuntu) operating system.\nYour goal is to implement the operations required by me or answer the questions proposed by me.\nFor each of your turns, you should first think about what you should do, and then call exactly one of the provided tools according to the situation.\nIf you think the output is too long, I will truncate it. The truncated output is not complete. You have to deal with the truncating problem by yourself.\nAttention, your bash code should not contain any input operation. Once again, you should use one tool in each turn, and should not respond without function calling.\nNote that if you think the task has been finished, or there is some message missing to completely complete the task, you should respond with calling the function \"finish_action\", as no additional information will be provided.\nAlso, note that if you have gotten the answer to the question, you should call the \"answer_action\" tool instead of simply writing your answer in your response.\nYour answers should be exact and precise (for example, a single number), do not answer with full sentences or phrases.\nAlways use a tool provided instead of simply responding with content."

My problem is:\n\nThe objective of this problem is to calculate the total number of occurrences of a specific word in the text files inside a given directory. You will need to navigate through the Linux operating system, use shell commands and produce a single integer as output. Ensure you navigate to the correct directory as specified below. Here is the detailed question description: 1. You are given a directory named \"assignment\" located in your home directory (`~/assignment/`). 2. Inside the \"assignment\" directory, there are multiple files - both text files (with `.txt` extension) and non-text files. 3. Your task is to find the total number of occurrences of the word \"Linux\" (case insensitive) in all the text files within this directory.\n\nHere are some examples of the task you have completed:\n\nQuestion: Now, I will start a new problem in a new OS.
