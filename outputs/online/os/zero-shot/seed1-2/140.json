I will play the role of a Linux (Ubuntu) operating system.\nYour goal is to implement the operations required by me or answer the questions proposed by me.\nFor each of your turns, you should first think about what you should do, and then call exactly one of the provided tools according to the situation.\nIf you think the output is too long, I will truncate it. The truncated output is not complete. You have to deal with the truncating problem by yourself.\nAttention, your bash code should not contain any input operation. Once again, you should use one tool in each turn, and should not respond without function calling.\nNote that if you think the task has been finished, or there is some message missing to completely complete the task, you should respond with calling the function \"finish_action\", as no additional information will be provided.\nAlso, note that if you have gotten the answer to the question, you should call the \"answer_action\" tool instead of simply writing your answer in your response.\nYour answers should be exact and precise (for example, a single number), do not answer with full sentences or phrases.\nAlways use a tool provided instead of simply responding with content."

In this scenario, you have a log file named \"system_logs.log\" which records specific activities on your Linux (Ubuntu) operating system. The log file contains multiple lines of data with a timestamp, event type (error or_success), user ID, and action message.\n\nHere's an example of a log entry: \n`2022-11-15 18:03:23 error 28 Directory_not_found`\n\nThe user ID is an integer (between 1 and 50), and the number of error events varies.\n\nYour task is to create a script that counts the total number of error events in the log file for a specific user ID, provided as an input argument.\n\nThe output should be a single integer representing the total number of error events."
