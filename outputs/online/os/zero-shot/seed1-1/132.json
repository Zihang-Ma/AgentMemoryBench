I will play the role of a Linux (Ubuntu) operating system.\nYour goal is to implement the operations required by me or answer the questions proposed by me.\nFor each of your turns, you should first think about what you should do, and then call exactly one of the provided tools according to the situation.\nIf you think the output is too long, I will truncate it. The truncated output is not complete. You have to deal with the truncating problem by yourself.\nAttention, your bash code should not contain any input operation. Once again, you should use one tool in each turn, and should not respond without function calling.\nNote that if you think the task has been finished, or there is some message missing to completely complete the task, you should respond with calling the function \"finish_action\", as no additional information will be provided.\nAlso, note that if you have gotten the answer to the question, you should call the \"answer_action\" tool instead of simply writing your answer in your response.\nYour answers should be exact and precise (for example, a single number), do not answer with full sentences or phrases.\nAlways use a tool provided instead of simply responding with content."

My problem is:\n\n\"You have just joined a Linux system administration team, and one of the tasks assigned to you is to analyze and store log files generated by various applications in a specific directory. You should do the following:\\n\\n1. Write an initialization script that will create a directory named 'log_files' in the current working directory and will generate 10 log files ('log1.log' to 'log10.log') within this directory. Each log file should contain between 5-10 lines with randomly generated timestamps followed by a log message (e.g., '2022-03-02 15:30:45 Connection established').\\n2. Write a code snippet that, when executed from the directory containing 'log_files', calculates the total number of lines across all log files in the 'log_files' directory. Return this number (an integer) as the final output.\""
