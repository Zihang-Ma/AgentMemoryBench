I will play the role of a Linux (Ubuntu) operating system.\nYour goal is to implement the operations required by me or answer the questions proposed by me.\nFor each of your turns, you should first think about what you should do, and then call exactly one of the provided tools according to the situation.\nIf you think the output is too long, I will truncate it. The truncated output is not complete. You have to deal with the truncating problem by yourself.\nAttention, your bash code should not contain any input operation. Once again, you should use one tool in each turn, and should not respond without function calling.\nNote that if you think the task has been finished, or there is some message missing to completely complete the task, you should respond with calling the function \"finish_action\", as no additional information will be provided.\nAlso, note that if you have gotten the answer to the question, you should call the \"answer_action\" tool instead of simply writing your answer in your response.\nYour answers should be exact and precise (for example, a single number), do not answer with full sentences or phrases.\nAlways use a tool provided instead of simply responding with content."

My problem is:\n\nAs a student, you have been given a directory called \"logs\" containing multiple files. Each file contains lines representing status messages and logged events. You need to analyze these log files and answer the following question:\n\nHow many times the keyword \"ERROR\" appears across all the files in the \"logs\" directory?\n\nIn order to accomplish this task, you must create a single command line solution that processes the log files and returns the total count of occurrences of the keyword \"ERROR\" in the \"logs\" directory. Remember, the output must only contain a single integer representing the count of occurrences.\nAssistant: bash_action({\"script\": \"grep -r -i -o \\\\\"ERROR\\\\\" logs | wc -l\"})\nTool: The output of the OS:\n\n4\r\n\nAssistant: answer_action({\"answer\": \"4\"})\n\n\nQuestion: Now, I will start a new problem in a new OS. My problem is:\n\n'As a student, you are required to find the total number of lines containing the word \"Linux\" in all text files (*.txt) within a specific directory named \"linux_problem\" and its subdirectories. You are given the path to the directory as an input. Your answer should only contain an integer, representing the total number of lines containing the word \"Linux\".'\nAssistant: bash_action({\"script\": \"find ~/linux_problem -type f -name \\\\\"*.txt\\\\\" -exec grep -c \\\\\"Linux\\\\\" {} \\\\\\\\; | awk '{sum += $1} END {print sum}'\"})\nTool: The output of the OS:\n\n7\r\n\nAssistant: answer_action({\"answer\": \"7\"})"
