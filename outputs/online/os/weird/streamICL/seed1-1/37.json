I will play the role of a Linux (Ubuntu) operating system.\nYour goal is to implement the operations required by me or answer the questions proposed by me.\nFor each of your turns, you should first think about what you should do, and then call exactly one of the provided tools according to the situation.\nIf you think the output is too long, I will truncate it. The truncated output is not complete. You have to deal with the truncating problem by yourself.\nAttention, your bash code should not contain any input operation. Once again, you should use one tool in each turn, and should not respond without function calling.\nNote that if you think the task has been finished, or there is some message missing to completely complete the task, you should respond with calling the function \"finish_action\", as no additional information will be provided.\nAlso, note that if you have gotten the answer to the question, you should call the \"answer_action\" tool instead of simply writing your answer in your response.\nYour answers should be exact and precise (for example, a single number), do not answer with full sentences or phrases.\nAlways use a tool provided instead of simply responding with content."

You need to calculate the sum of all integer values from all these text files, and output the result as an integer.\n\nIn summary, your task is to:\n\n1. Enter the \"reports\" directory.\n2.

My problem is:\n\n'You are given a directory named \"files\" within your current working directory, which contains a variable number of text files. Each text file contains a single line of comma-separated integers. Your task is to compute the sum of all integers in each file, and then find the highest sum among all the files in the directory.\\\\n\\\\nFirst, execute an initialization bash script to deploy the environment required for the problem. After executing the script, you will find a directory named \"files\" directly under your current working directory containing multiple text files.\\\\n\\\\nYour job is to interact with the shell to calculate the sum of integers in each file inside the \"files\" directory and find the highest sum.

The directory will contain various subdirectories, and you are required to go through every subdirectory to count all the text files' characters, words, lines, and total folders.\\\\n\\\\nYou need to use shell commands to get the results efficiently. You are required to provide a single integer, which represents the computed total as follows:\\\\n\\\\nTotal = characters + words + lines + folders\\\\n\\\\nKeep in mind that you only need to count text files (files with the .txt extension).\"\nAssistant: bash_action({\"script\": \"find ~/test_directory -type f -name \\\\\"*.txt\\\\\" -exec wc -c {} + | awk '{sum += $1} END {print sum}' && find ~/test_directory -type f -name \\\\\"*.txt\\\\\" -exec wc -w {} + | awk '{sum += $1} END {print sum}' && find ~/test_directory -type f -name \\\\\"*.txt\\\\\" -exec wc -l {} + | awk '{sum += $1} END {print sum}' && find ~/test_directory -type d | wc -l\"})\nTool: The output of the OS:\n\n132\r\n24\r\n6\r\n4\r\n\nAssistant: answer_action({\"answer\": \"166\"})\n\n\nQuestion: Now, I will start a new problem in a new OS.
