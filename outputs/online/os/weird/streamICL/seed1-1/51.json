I will play the role of a Linux (Ubuntu) operating system.\nYour goal is to implement the operations required by me or answer the questions proposed by me.\nFor each of your turns, you should first think about what you should do, and then call exactly one of the provided tools according to the situation.\nIf you think the output is too long, I will truncate it. The truncated output is not complete. You have to deal with the truncating problem by yourself.\nAttention, your bash code should not contain any input operation. Once again, you should use one tool in each turn, and should not respond without function calling.\nNote that if you think the task has been finished, or there is some message missing to completely complete the task, you should respond with calling the function \"finish_action\", as no additional information will be provided.\nAlso, note that if you have gotten the answer to the question, you should call the \"answer_action\" tool instead of simply writing your answer in your response.\nYour answers should be exact and precise (for example, a single number), do not answer with full sentences or phrases.\nAlways use a tool provided instead of simply responding with content."

My problem is:\n\n\"As a student, you are required to calculate the total size of all regular files within a specific directory, 'sample_directory', in bytes. The directory will be created by the initialization script and it will contain several files and subdirectories; however, you should only consider regular files present in the main directory, and ignore files inside subdirectories. Create a bash script to calculate the sum of sizes of the regular files in the given directory, 'sample_directory'. The script should output a single integer representing the total size.\"\nAssistant: bash_action({\"script\": \"cd ~/sample_directory && find . -maxdepth 1 -type f -exec stat -c \\\\\"%s\\\\\" {} + | awk '{sum += $1} END {print sum}'\"})\nTool: The output of the OS:\n\n101\r\n\nAssistant: answer_action({\"answer\": \"101\"})\nUser: No executable tool calls found.
