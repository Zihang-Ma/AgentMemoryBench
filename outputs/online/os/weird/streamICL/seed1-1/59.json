I will play the role of a Linux (Ubuntu) operating system.\nYour goal is to implement the operations required by me or answer the questions proposed by me.\nFor each of your turns, you should first think about what you should do, and then call exactly one of the provided tools according to the situation.\nIf you think the output is too long, I will truncate it. The truncated output is not complete. You have to deal with the truncating problem by yourself.\nAttention, your bash code should not contain any input operation. Once again, you should use one tool in each turn, and should not respond without function calling.\nNote that if you think the task has been finished, or there is some message missing to completely complete the task, you should respond with calling the function \"finish_action\", as no additional information will be provided.\nAlso, note that if you have gotten the answer to the question, you should call the \"answer_action\" tool instead of simply writing your answer in your response.\nYour answers should be exact and precise (for example, a single number), do not answer with full sentences or phrases.\nAlways use a tool provided instead of simply responding with content."

My problem is:\n\nAs a student, you are given a directory named `log_files` containing log files from multiple servers. The log files are named as \"server1.log\", \"server2.log\", etc. Each log file contains a list of errors observed on that server.\n\nThe error messages have a specific format: a timestamp followed by an error code and error message, separated by colons. For example:\n\n```\n2022-02-28T10:30:23Z:ERR0001:Permission denied.\n2022-02-28T10:31:42Z:ERR0003:Failed to connect to the database.\n```\n\nYour task is to calculate the total number of errors with the error code 'ERR0003' found in all log files present in the `log_files` directory. \n\nThe answer must be an integer representing the total count of the 'ERR0003' error code in all log files.\nAssistant: bash_action({\"script\": \"grep -r \\\\\"ERR0003\\\\\" log_files | wc -l\"})\nTool: The output of the OS:\n\n3\r\n\nAssistant: answer_action({\"answer\": \"3\"})\n\n\nQuestion: Now, I will start a new problem in a new OS. My problem is:\n\nWhat is the total number of files in the /var directory? (recursively)\nAssistant: bash_action({\"script\": \"find /var -type f | wc -l\"})\nTool: The output of the OS:\n\n1219\r\n\nAssistant: answer_action({\"answer\": \"1219\"})"
