I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

Verify the update by selecting the record with the new values to ensure the changes were applied correctly.\n\nGiven that the user provides the name and headers of a table, this workflow fetches the table information and retrieves the earliest game with a specific score.\n[step 1: Fetch table headers and name]\nDESCRIBE `Game Results`;\n[step 2: Query for the earliest game with a score of 99-89]\nSELECT * FROM `Game Results` WHERE Score = '99-89' ORDER BY Date ASC LIMIT 1;\n\nVerify the column name for the destination team is correctly referenced as {column_name} (e.g., 'Transferred to'). Insert the new transfer record with values ['8', 'MF', 'Andrés Iniesta', 'Vissel Kobe', 'Transfer fee: $30 million', 'In 2018'] into the transfers table.\n\nUpdate the name in the 'Name' column where 'Rank' is 'Men', 'Nationality' is 'Russia', and 'Time' is for the 200m backstroke\n\nGiven that the task is to query a specific table for summing up goals, this workflow extracts the required data.\n[step 1 description with {player_name} placeholder] - Select the rows where the player name is {player_name}.\n[step 2 description with {player_name} and {total_goals} placeholders] - Sum up the values in the \"Total Goals\" column for the selected rows where the player name is {player_name} and return the total as {total_goals}.\n"
