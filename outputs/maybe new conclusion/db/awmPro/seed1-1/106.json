I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

Identify the row in the table {table_name} where the Rank is equal to {rank}.\n2. Update the Lake(s) column of the identified row to {lake}.\n\nGiven that the task is to change the Notes for a specific entry in the athlete_high_jump_records table, this workflow updates the Notes field.\n[step 1 description: Query the database to find the entry with the specified Year, Competition, and Event]\nSELECT * FROM athlete_high_jump_records WHERE Year = 2009 AND Competition = 'World Championships' AND Event = 'High Jump';\n[step 2 description: Update the Notes field for the found entry]\nUPDATE athlete_high_jump_records SET Notes = '2.40 m' WHERE Year = 2009 AND Competition = 'World Championships' AND Event = 'High Jump';\n\nIdentify the row in the Hotels table where the Hotel column matches \\{hotel_name\\}. Update the Notes column of the identified row to \\{new_notes\\}.\n\nGiven that the user is querying a table that initially does not exist, this workflow checks for the table's existence and handles the case where it does not exist.\n[step 1] Check if the table 'Maryland_State_Legislature_Representatives' exists.\n[step 2] If the table does not exist, return an error message indicating the table does not exist.\n\nInsert a new row into the \"Tour de France Winners by Stage\" table with the values: {year}, {stage}, {start_of_stage}, {distance_km}, {category_of_climb}, {stage_winner}, {nationality}, {yellow_jersey}, {bend}. Verify the insertion by checking if the new row with values {year}, {stage}, {start_of_stage}, {distance_km}, {category_of_climb}, {stage_winner}, {nationality}, {yellow_jersey}, {bend} exists in the table.\n\nGiven that the user needs to retrieve specific data from the table, this workflow constructs and executes a query to find the required information.\n[step 1] Construct a query to select the 'First Elected' year where 'District' is 11 and 'Committee' is 'environmental matters'.\n[step 2] Execute the query and return the result.\n\nGiven that the user wants to update a specific row in a table, this workflow checks if the table exists.\n[step 1 description: Check if the table exists, where {table_name} is the name of the table]\n\\nSELECT * FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_name = \\'{table_name}\\';\n[step 2 description: Raise an error if the table does not exist]\n\\nIF NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_name = \\'{table_name}\\') THEN\n    RAISE EXCEPTION 'Table does not exist';\nEND IF;\n"
