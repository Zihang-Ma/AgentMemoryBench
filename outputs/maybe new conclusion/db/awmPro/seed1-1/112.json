I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

[step 1 description with {team_name} and {seasons_since_win} placeholders] - Update the 'Team' column to {team_name} and the 'Seasons since win' column to {seasons_since_win} in the NBA Playoff History table. [step 2 description with {last_series_win} and {losing_streak} placeholders] - Update the 'Last series win in NBA Playoffs' column to {last_series_win} and the 'Losing streak' column to {losing_streak} in the NBA Playoff History table. [step 3 description with {series_losses_teams} placeholder] - Update the 'Series losses - teams' column to include {series_losses_teams} in the NBA Playoff History table.\n\nFind the row in the MMA Fight Record where the opponent is {opponent_name}. Extract the \"Event\" column value from the row where the opponent is {opponent_name}.\n\nGiven that the task is to find the fewest number of games played in the football_standings table, this workflow extracts and returns the row with the minimum games played.\n[step 1 description: Extract the row with the minimum value in the \"Games played\" column]\nSELECT * FROM football_standings ORDER BY Games_played ASC LIMIT 1\n[step 2 description: Return the extracted row]\nRETURN extracted_row\n\nSELECT Round FROM tennis_results WHERE Winner = 'Ivanovic' AND Year < 2008 AND Tournament = 'Paris'\n\nGiven that the task is to insert a new record into the 'Athlete Results' table, this workflow specifies the process of adding a new entry with specific details.\n[step 1 description with {year}, {competition}, {venue}, {position}, {event}, {notes} placeholders]\n[step 2 description with {year}, {competition}, {venue}, {position}, {event}, {notes} placeholders]\n"
