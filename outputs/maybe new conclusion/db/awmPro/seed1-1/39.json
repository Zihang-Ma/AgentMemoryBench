I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

Identify the row in the table {table_name} where the Rank is equal to {rank}.\n2. Update the Lake(s) column of the identified row to {lake}.\n\nGiven that the task is to filter game results based on game numbers under 20 and the opponent is Portland, this workflow extracts the relevant score.\n[step 1 description with {game_number} and {opponent} placeholders]\n- Filter the `game_results` table for rows where `Game` is less than {game_number} and `Team` is {opponent}.\n[step 2 description with {filtered_results} placeholder]\n- From the filtered results, select the `Score` column.\nfiltered_results = game_results[(game_results['Game'] < {game_number}) & (game_results['Team'] == {opponent})]['Score']\n\nGiven that the user needs to query specific columns from the table, this workflow extracts the headers of the table to ensure the columns are correctly identified.\n[step 1] Extract the headers of the table 'Maryland_State_Legislature_Representatives'.\n[step 2] Verify if the required columns ('First Elected', 'District', 'Committee') exist in the table headers.\n"
