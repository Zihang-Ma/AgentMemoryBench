I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

Update the specified information for the player, such as height and current club, to {new_info} in the Basketball Players table.\n\nUpdate the NBA Playoff History table for the Los Angeles Clippers. [step 1 description with {team_name} and {seasons_since_win} placeholders] - Update the 'Team' column to {team_name} and the 'Seasons since win' column to {seasons_since_win} in the NBA Playoff History table. [step 2 description with {last_series_win} and {losing_streak} placeholders] - Update the 'Last series win in NBA Playoffs' column to {last_series_win} and the 'Losing streak' column to {losing_streak} in the NBA Playoff History table. [step 3 description with {series_losses_teams} placeholder] - Update the 'Series losses - teams' column to include {series_losses_teams} in the NBA Playoff History table.\n\nGiven that the task is to filter game results based on game numbers under 20 and the opponent is Portland, this workflow extracts the relevant score.\n[step 1 description with {game_number} and {opponent} placeholders]\n- Filter the `game_results` table for rows where `Game` is less than {game_number} and `Team` is {opponent}.\n[step 2 description with {filtered_results} placeholder]\n- From the filtered results, select the `Score` column.\nfiltered_results = game_results[(game_results['Game'] < {game_number}) & (game_results['Team'] == {opponent})]['Score']\n\nUpdate the row in the Game Statistics table where the Game column matches {game_id} with the new value for High points, which is {high_points}.\\nUpdate the same row in the Game Statistics table where the Game column matches {game_id} with the new value for High rebounds, which is {high_rebounds}.\n\nGiven that the user provides the name and headers of a table, this workflow fetches the table information and retrieves the earliest game with a specific score.\n[step 1: Fetch table headers and name]\nDESCRIBE `Game Results`;\n[step 2: Query for the earliest game with a score of 99-89]\nSELECT * FROM `Game Results` WHERE Score = '99-89' ORDER BY Date ASC LIMIT 1;\n\nIdentify the player to be updated, which in this case is {player_name}. Update the player's height to {height} and current club to {current_club} in the Basketball Players table.\n"
