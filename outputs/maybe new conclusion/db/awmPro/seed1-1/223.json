I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

[step 1 description with {team_name} and {seasons_since_win} placeholders] - Update the 'Team' column to {team_name} and the 'Seasons since win' column to {seasons_since_win} in the NBA Playoff History table. [step 2 description with {last_series_win} and {losing_streak} placeholders] - Update the 'Last series win in NBA Playoffs' column to {last_series_win} and the 'Losing streak' column to {losing_streak} in the NBA Playoff History table. [step 3 description with {series_losses_teams} placeholder] - Update the 'Series losses - teams' column to include {series_losses_teams} in the NBA Playoff History table.\n\nGiven that the task is to update a specific percentage in a database table, this workflow describes how to perform the update.\n[step 1 description with {year}, {religion}, {new_percentage} placeholders]\n[step 2 description with {table_name} placeholder]\n\n### Steps\n1. Identify the row in the {table_name} where the {religion} column corresponds to the specified {year}.\n2. Update the percentage value in the identified row to the new {new_percentage}.\n\nGiven that the task is to change the Notes for a specific entry in the athlete_high_jump_records table, this workflow updates the Notes field.\n[step 1 description: Query the database to find the entry with the specified Year, Competition, and Event]\nSELECT * FROM athlete_high_jump_records WHERE Year = 2009 AND Competition = 'World Championships' AND Event = 'High Jump';\n[step 2 description: Update the Notes field for the found entry]\nUPDATE athlete_high_jump_records SET Notes = '2.40 m' WHERE Year = 2009 AND Competition = 'World Championships' AND Event = 'High Jump';\n\nGiven that we need to update the stadium information for a specific team, this workflow updates the stadium and location details in the Team_Location_Stadium table.\n[step 1 description: Update the Stadium column for the specified Team to {stadium_name}]\n[step 2 description: Update the Location column for the specified Team to {location_city}]\nExample:\n- {stadium_name} = \\\"Ibrox Stadium\\\"\n- {location_city} = \\\"Glasgow\\\"\n\nGiven that the task is to update specific records in the 'athlete_performance' table, this workflow outlines the process of updating the athlete's performance data.\nUPDATE athlete_performance SET Position = {new_position}, Competition = {new_competition}, Venue = {new_venue} WHERE Event = {event} AND Position = {position} AND Year = {year} AND Competition = {competition} AND Venue = {venue};\nSELECT * FROM athlete_performance WHERE Event = {event} AND Position = {position} AND Year = {year} AND Competition = {competition} AND Venue = {venue};\n\nGiven that the task is to update a specific record in the 'Great Lakes Metropolitan Areas Population and Lakes' table based on the 'Rank' column, this workflow updates the 'Lake(s)' column.\n1. Identify the row in the table {table_name} where the Rank is equal to {rank}.\n2. Update the Lake(s) column of the identified row to {lake}.\n\nGiven that the task is to update the points of a specific team in the standings table, this workflow automates the process.\n[step 1] Connect to the database where the standings table is located.\n[step 2] Execute an SQL update query to set the Points column to 6 for the row where Name is 'ESC Kempten II (N).'\n[step 3] Commit the changes and close the database connection.\n\nGiven that the table does not exist and column names need to be adjusted, this workflow creates the necessary table with correct column names.\n[step 1 description: Create the table with the correct column names]\nCREATE TABLE State_Parks_Table (\n    Park_Name TEXT,\n    County_or_Counties TEXT,\n    Area_in_acres TEXT,\n    Year_Established TEXT,\n    Water_Body_s TEXT\n);\n[step 2 description: Insert the new park information into the table]\nINSERT INTO State_Parks_Table (Park_Name, County_or_Counties, Area_in_acres, Year_Established, Water_Body_s)\nVALUES ('Osage Hills State Park', 'Osage', '1, 100', '1936', '');\n"
