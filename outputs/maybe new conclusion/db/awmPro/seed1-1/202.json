I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

Verify the update by checking if the `Nationality` of the row where `Recipient` is equal to `{person_name}` has been changed to `{new_nationality}`.\n\nGiven that the task involves querying a database table, this workflow extracts the correct table name from the provided headers.\n[step 1 description: Identify the correct table name from the headers]\nSELECT table_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE column_name = 'IATA'\n[step 2 description: Extract the table name]\nSELECT table_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE column_name = 'IATA'\n\nIdentify the row in the `racing_career` table where the `Season` is `{season}`.

Identify the row in the table {table_name} where the Rank is equal to {rank}.\n2. Update the Lake(s) column of the identified row to {lake}.\n\nGiven that the task is to change the Notes for a specific entry in the athlete_high_jump_records table, this workflow updates the Notes field.\n[step 1 description: Query the database to find the entry with the specified Year, Competition, and Event]\nSELECT * FROM athlete_high_jump_records WHERE Year = 2009 AND Competition = 'World Championships' AND Event = 'High Jump';\n[step 2 description: Update the Notes field for the found entry]\nUPDATE athlete_high_jump_records SET Notes = '2.40 m' WHERE Year = 2009 AND Competition = 'World Championships' AND Event = 'High Jump';\n"
