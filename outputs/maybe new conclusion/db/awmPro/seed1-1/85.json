I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

Append the new entry to the table named {table_name}: 'Country': {country}, 'Province / State': {province_state}, 'City': {city}, 'Airport': {airport_name}.\n\nUpdate the team name in the table {table_name} to \\\"Barcelona\\\" for the row where Position is {position}.\\nVerify the update by checking the row in {table_name} where Position is {position} to ensure the team name is correctly updated to \\\"Barcelona\\\"\n\nGiven that the task involves querying a database table, this workflow extracts the correct table name from the provided headers.\n[step 1 description: Identify the correct table name from the headers]\nSELECT table_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE column_name = 'IATA'\n[step 2 description: Extract the table name]\nSELECT table_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE column_name = 'IATA'\n\nLocate the row in the {table_name} where the {country} is \\\"Germany\\\". Set the value of the \\\"Shared elements\\\" column for that row to \\\"2\\\"\n\nGiven that the table does not exist and column names need to be adjusted, this workflow creates the necessary table with correct column names.\n[step 1 description: Create the table with the correct column names]\nCREATE TABLE State_Parks_Table (\n    Park_Name TEXT,\n    County_or_Counties TEXT,\n    Area_in_acres TEXT,\n    Year_Established TEXT,\n    Water_Body_s TEXT\n);\n[step 2 description: Insert the new park information into the table]\nINSERT INTO State_Parks_Table (Park_Name, County_or_Counties, Area_in_acres, Year_Established, Water_Body_s)\nVALUES ('Osage Hills State Park', 'Osage', '1, 100', '1936', '');\n\nPrepare the SQL Insert Statement: Construct the SQL insert statement for the table 'Aerial Tramways and Cable Cars' with columns 'Name', 'Year built', 'Country', 'Town', 'Height', and 'Remarks'.\nExecute the Insert Statement: Execute the constructed SQL insert statement with the values 'Sugarloaf Mountain Cable Car', '1912', 'Brazil', 'Rio de Janeiro', '396 m', and 'One of the longest cable car rides in the world'.\n\nCreate a table named Rankings with the following columns:\\n- Rank (text)\\n- Member Association (text)\\n- Points (text)\\n- Group stage (text)\\n- Play-off (text)\\n- AFC Cup (text)\\n\\nInsert the data into the Rankings table.\n\nGiven that the task is to update the city name for a specific rank in the 'Airport Passengers' table, this workflow handles the update operation.\n[step 1 description with {table_name} and {rank} placeholders]\nUPDATE {table_name} SET City = 'Haarlemmermeer' WHERE Rank = {rank};\n[step 2 description with {table_name} and {rank} placeholders]\nVerify the update by selecting the record with the specified rank.\nSELECT * FROM {table_name} WHERE Rank = {rank};\n"
