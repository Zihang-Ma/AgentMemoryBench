I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

Identify the row in the table {table_name} where the Rank is equal to {rank}.\n2. Update the Lake(s) column of the identified row to {lake}.\n\nGiven that the task involves updating specific medal counts in the Olympic Medal Table, this workflow updates the bronze count and total count for a given nation.\n[step 1 description with {nation} placeholder] Identify the row in the Olympic Medal Table where the nation is {nation}.\n[step 2 description with {nation} and {bronze_count} placeholders] Update the bronze count for {nation} to {bronze_count}.\n[step 3 description with {nation} and {total_count} placeholders] Increment the total count for {nation} by 1.\n[step 4 description] Save the changes to the Olympic Medal Table.\n\nGiven that the provided column names do not match the expected table schema, this workflow checks and corrects the column names.\nVerify the column names against the table schema\nif column_names != expected_column_names:\n    column_names = expected_column_names\n\nInsert data into the table with corrected column names\n\\ndata = [('Pelister', '1-3', 'Akademija Pandev', '0-1', '1-2')]\nquery = f\"INSERT INTO Football Match Results ({', '.join(column_names)}) VALUES ({', '.join(['%s'] * len(data[0]))})\"\nexecute_query(query, data)\n\nCreate a table named Rankings with the following columns:\\n- Rank (text)\\n- Member Association (text)\\n- Points (text)\\n- Group stage (text)\\n- Play-off (text)\\n- AFC Cup (text)\\n\\nInsert the data into the Rankings table.\n\nCheck if the table 'dbbench_5120352a_dcdc_4485_abe9_8477fee948ed.table' exists.\nIf the table exists, update the 'Pos' and 'Name' columns to 'FW' and 'Yuji Senuma' respectively, where the 'No' column is equal to '20'.
