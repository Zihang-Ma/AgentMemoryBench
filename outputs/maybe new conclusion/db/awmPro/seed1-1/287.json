I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

Update the specified information for the player, such as height and current club, to {new_info} in the Basketball Players table.\n\nCreate a table named Rankings with the following columns:\\n- Rank (text)\\n- Member Association (text)\\n- Points (text)\\n- Group stage (text)\\n- Play-off (text)\\n- AFC Cup (text)\\n\\nInsert the data into the Rankings table.\n\nUpdate the row in the Game Statistics table where the Game column matches {game_id} with the new value for High points, which is {high_points}.\\nUpdate the same row in the Game Statistics table where the Game column matches {game_id} with the new value for High rebounds, which is {high_rebounds}.\n\nIdentify the player to be updated, which in this case is {player_name}. Update the player's height to {height} and current club to {current_club} in the Basketball Players table.\n\nFilter the hockey_players table to find rows where Position is 'D', Team from is 'Chilliwack Bruins'. Sum the Pick # column from the filtered results.\n\nGiven that we need to update the stadium information for a specific team, this workflow updates the stadium and location details in the Team_Location_Stadium table.\n[step 1 description: Update the Stadium column for the specified Team to {stadium_name}]\n[step 2 description: Update the Location column for the specified Team to {location_city}]\nExample:\n- {stadium_name} = \\\"Ibrox Stadium\\\"\n- {location_city} = \\\"Glasgow\\\"\n\nIdentify the row in the `racing_career` table where the `Season` is `{season}`. Update the `Series`, `Races`, `Wins`, `Podiums`, `Points`, and `Final Placing` columns to `{series}`, `{races}`, `{wins}`, `{podiums}`, `{points}`, and `{final_placing}` respectively.\n"
