I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

If the table does not exist, handle the non-existence appropriately.\n\nUpdate the team name in the table {table_name} to \\\"Barcelona\\\" for the row where Position is {position}.\\nVerify the update by checking the row in {table_name} where Position is {position} to ensure the team name is correctly updated to \\\"Barcelona\\\"\n\nGiven that the table does not exist and column names need to be adjusted, this workflow creates the necessary table with correct column names.\n[step 1 description: Create the table with the correct column names]\nCREATE TABLE State_Parks_Table (\n    Park_Name TEXT,\n    County_or_Counties TEXT,\n    Area_in_acres TEXT,\n    Year_Established TEXT,\n    Water_Body_s TEXT\n);\n[step 2 description: Insert the new park information into the table]\nINSERT INTO State_Parks_Table (Park_Name, County_or_Counties, Area_in_acres, Year_Established, Water_Body_s)\nVALUES ('Osage Hills State Park', 'Osage', '1, 100', '1936', '');\n\nGiven that the task is to update a specific record in the Monarchies table, this workflow updates the note for a given monarch.\n[step 1 description with {monarch_name} and {new_note} placeholders]\n[step 2 description with {table_name} and {monarch_name} placeholders]\n\n### Steps:\n1. Identify the row in the {table_name} where the {monarch_name} is 'Mswati III'.\n2. Update the 'Note' column of the identified row to 'Former monarch'.\n\nUpdate the `Nationality` column of the row where `Recipient` is equal to `{person_name}` in the `speeches` table to `{new_nationality}`. Verify the update by checking if the `Nationality` of the row where `Recipient` is equal to `{person_name}` has been changed to `{new_nationality}`.\n\nGiven that the task is to change the Notes for a specific entry in the athlete_high_jump_records table, this workflow updates the Notes field.\n[step 1 description: Query the database to find the entry with the specified Year, Competition, and Event]\nSELECT * FROM athlete_high_jump_records WHERE Year = 2009 AND Competition = 'World Championships' AND Event = 'High Jump';\n[step 2 description: Update the Notes field for the found entry]\nUPDATE athlete_high_jump_records SET Notes = '2.40 m' WHERE Year = 2009 AND Competition = 'World Championships' AND Event = 'High Jump';\n\nGiven that the table headers are provided, this workflow ensures the correct headers are used in the query.\n[step 1] Verify the table name is 'Movies'.\n[step 2] Confirm the headers match the provided list: ['Year', 'Title', 'Role', 'Director', 'Notes'].\n\nGiven that the task involves updating specific medal counts in the Olympic Medal Table, this workflow updates the bronze count and total count for a given nation.\n[step 1 description with {nation} placeholder] Identify the row in the Olympic Medal Table where the nation is {nation}.\n[step 2 description with {nation} and {bronze_count} placeholders] Update the bronze count for {nation} to {bronze_count}.\n[step 3 description with {nation} and {total_count} placeholders] Increment the total count for {nation} by 1.\n[step 4 description] Save the changes to the Olympic Medal Table.\n"
