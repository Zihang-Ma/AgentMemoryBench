I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

Prepare the data to be inserted: {year}, {title}, {role}, and {notes}.\n2. Execute the SQL insert statement: INSERT INTO Movie_Credits (Year, Title, Role, Notes) VALUES ('{year}', '{title}', '{role}', '{notes}');\n\nGiven that the task is to insert data into the 'movies_roles' table, this workflow describes how to perform the insertion.\n[step 1 description with {year} placeholder]\n[step 2 description with {title} and {role} placeholders]\n\n### Steps:\n1. Construct the SQL command to insert the data into the 'movies_roles' table using the year {year}.\n2. Execute the SQL command with the title {title} and role {role}.\n\nNote: Ensure that the year, title, and role values are correctly formatted and sanitized before executing the SQL command to avoid errors.\n\nGiven that the task is to update a specific field in a database table, this workflow updates the Notes field in the Movies table.\n[step 1] Construct the SQL update query: `UPDATE Movies SET Notes = '{notes_value}' WHERE Title = '{title_value}'`.\n[step 2] Execute the SQL query using a database connection or tool.\n\nSet the 'Notes' column to NULL in the 'movie_production' table based on a specific 'Title'.\n[step 1 description with {title} placeholder]\nUPDATE movie_production\nSET Notes = NULL\nWHERE Title = '{title}';\n[step 2 description with {title} placeholder]\nExecute the SQL query to update the 'movie_production' table where the 'Title' is '{title}'.\n\nGiven that the task is to set the notes to '-' for old films before 2010 in the filmography table, this workflow updates the table accordingly.\n[step 1 description with {table_name} and {year_column} placeholders]\n[step 2 description with {table_name}, {year_column}, and {notes_column} placeholders]\n\n1. Select all rows from the {table_name} where the value in the {year_column} is less than 2010.\n2. Update the {notes_column} to '-' for the selected rows.\n\nGiven that the task is to find an episode based on the director and its position in the season, this workflow constructs and executes a SQL query to retrieve the required information.\n[step 1 description with {variable} placeholders]\nSELECT Title, No. in season, No. in series, Original air date, Production code, U.S. viewers (millions), Written by \nFROM episode_table \nWHERE `Directed by` = '{director_name}' AND `No. in season` < {episode_season}\n[step 2 description with {variable} placeholders]\nExecute the constructed SQL query and return the results.\n"
