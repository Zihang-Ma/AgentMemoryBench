I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

Append the new entry to the table named {table_name}: 'Country': {country}, 'Province / State': {province_state}, 'City': {city}, 'Airport': {airport_name}.\n\nGiven that the user provides the name and headers of a table, this workflow fetches the table information and retrieves the earliest game with a specific score.\n[step 1: Fetch table headers and name]\nDESCRIBE `Game Results`;\n[step 2: Query for the earliest game with a score of 99-89]\nSELECT * FROM `Game Results` WHERE Score = '99-89' ORDER BY Date ASC LIMIT 1;\n\nGiven that the task is to change the Notes for a specific entry in the athlete_high_jump_records table, this workflow updates the Notes field.\n[step 1 description: Query the database to find the entry with the specified Year, Competition, and Event]\nSELECT * FROM athlete_high_jump_records WHERE Year = 2009 AND Competition = 'World Championships' AND Event = 'High Jump';\n[step 2 description: Update the Notes field for the found entry]\nUPDATE athlete_high_jump_records SET Notes = '2.40 m' WHERE Year = 2009 AND Competition = 'World Championships' AND Event = 'High Jump';\n\nLocate the row in the 'Tournament Results by Year' table where the 'Tournament' column value is 'Australian Open'.

Extract the \"Country of origin\" from the filtered row.\n\nGiven that the task is to set the notes to '-' for old films before 2010 in the filmography table, this workflow updates the table accordingly.\n[step 1 description with {table_name} and {year_column} placeholders]\n[step 2 description with {table_name}, {year_column}, and {notes_column} placeholders]\n\n1.
