I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

Identify the row in the table {table_name} where the Rank is equal to {rank}.\n2. Update the Lake(s) column of the identified row to {lake}.\n\nGiven that the user provides the name and headers of a table, this workflow fetches the table information and retrieves the earliest game with a specific score.\n[step 1: Fetch table headers and name]\nDESCRIBE `Game Results`;\n[step 2: Query for the earliest game with a score of 99-89]\nSELECT * FROM `Game Results` WHERE Score = '99-89' ORDER BY Date ASC LIMIT 1;\n\nUpdate the row in the Game Statistics table where the Game column matches {game_id} with the new value for High points, which is {high_points}.\\nUpdate the same row in the Game Statistics table where the Game column matches {game_id} with the new value for High rebounds, which is {high_rebounds}.\n\nGiven that the table headers are provided, this workflow ensures the correct headers are used in the query.\n[step 1] Verify the table name is 'Movies'.\n[step 2] Confirm the headers match the provided list: ['Year', 'Title', 'Role', 'Director', 'Notes'].\n\nGiven that the task is to count the number of schools with a specific website, this workflow queries the database to find the count.\n[step 1 description: Query the table to find the count of schools with the specified website]\nSELECT COUNT(*) FROM Schools Information WHERE School_website = 'http://www.camp.herts.sch.uk/';\n[step 2 description: Extract the count of schools with the specified website]\nSELECT COUNT(*) AS school_count FROM Schools Information WHERE School_website = 'http://www.camp.herts.sch.uk/';\n\nGiven that we need to update a specific entry in a table, this workflow updates the value of a column for a given row.\n\n[step 1] Identify the table name and the row identifier. In this case, the table name is {table_name} and the row identifier is {row_identifier}.\n[step 2] Update the specified column with the new value. Here, the column to update is {column_name} and the new value is {new_value}.\n\nGiven that the table does not exist and column names need to be adjusted, this workflow creates the necessary table with correct column names.\n[step 1 description: Create the table with the correct column names]\nCREATE TABLE State_Parks_Table (\n    Park_Name TEXT,\n    County_or_Counties TEXT,\n    Area_in_acres TEXT,\n    Year_Established TEXT,\n    Water_Body_s TEXT\n);\n[step 2 description: Insert the new park information into the table]\nINSERT INTO State_Parks_Table (Park_Name, County_or_Counties, Area_in_acres, Year_Established, Water_Body_s)\nVALUES ('Osage Hills State Park', 'Osage', '1, 100', '1936', '');\n"
