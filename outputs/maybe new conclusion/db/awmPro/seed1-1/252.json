I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

Update the specified information for the player, such as height and current club, to {new_info} in the Basketball Players table.\n\nUpdate the NBA Playoff History table for the Los Angeles Clippers. [step 1 description with {team_name} and {seasons_since_win} placeholders] - Update the 'Team' column to {team_name} and the 'Seasons since win' column to {seasons_since_win} in the NBA Playoff History table.

[step 3 description with {series_losses_teams} placeholder] - Update the 'Series losses - teams' column to include {series_losses_teams} in the NBA Playoff History table.\n\nIdentify the player to be updated, which in this case is {player_name}. Update the player's height to {height} and current club to {current_club} in the Basketball Players table.\n\nGiven that the task is to insert game results into the game_results table, this workflow describes how to do it.\n[step 1 description with {date}, {opponent}, {score}, {loss}, {attendance}, {record} placeholders]\nINSERT INTO game_results (Date, Opponent, Score, Loss, Attendance, Record) VALUES ('{date}', '{opponent}', '{score}', '{loss}', '{attendance}', '{record}');\n[step 2 description with {values} placeholder]\nEXECUTE THE ABOVE SQL QUERY WITH VALUES = ('{date}', '{opponent}', '{score}', '{loss}', '{attendance}', '{record}');\n\nIdentify the row in the `racing_career` table where the `Season` is `{season}`.
