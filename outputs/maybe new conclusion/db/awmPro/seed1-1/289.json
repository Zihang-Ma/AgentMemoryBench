I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

Append the new entry to the table named {table_name}: 'Country': {country}, 'Province / State': {province_state}, 'City': {city}, 'Airport': {airport_name}.\n\nGiven that the table headers are provided, this workflow ensures the correct headers are used in the query.\n[step 1] Verify the table name is 'Movies'.\n[step 2] Confirm the headers match the provided list: ['Year', 'Title', 'Role', 'Director', 'Notes'].\n\nGiven that the task is to set the notes to '-' for old films before 2010 in the filmography table, this workflow updates the table accordingly.\n[step 1 description with {table_name} and {year_column} placeholders]\n[step 2 description with {table_name}, {year_column}, and {notes_column} placeholders]\n\n1. Select all rows from the {table_name} where the value in the {year_column} is less than 2010.\n2. Update the {notes_column} to '-' for the selected rows.\n\nGiven that the task is to change the Notes for a specific entry in the athlete_high_jump_records table, this workflow updates the Notes field.\n[step 1 description: Query the database to find the entry with the specified Year, Competition, and Event]\nSELECT * FROM athlete_high_jump_records WHERE Year = 2009 AND Competition = 'World Championships' AND Event = 'High Jump';\n[step 2 description: Update the Notes field for the found entry]\nUPDATE athlete_high_jump_records SET Notes = '2.40 m' WHERE Year = 2009 AND Competition = 'World Championships' AND Event = 'High Jump';\n\nGiven that the task is to update a specific event's theme in a table, this workflow updates the theme for a given event.\n[step 1 description with {year} and {new_theme} placeholders]\n[step 2 description with {year} and {table_name} placeholders]\n\n### Steps\n1. Locate the row in the {table_name} where the {year} is 2030.\n2. Update the {theme} column of the located row to 'Unity'.\n\nGiven that the table does not exist and column names need to be adjusted, this workflow creates the necessary table with correct column names.\n[step 1 description: Create the table with the correct column names]\nCREATE TABLE State_Parks_Table (\n    Park_Name TEXT,\n    County_or_Counties TEXT,\n    Area_in_acres TEXT,\n    Year_Established TEXT,\n    Water_Body_s TEXT\n);\n[step 2 description: Insert the new park information into the table]\nINSERT INTO State_Parks_Table (Park_Name, County_or_Counties, Area_in_acres, Year_Established, Water_Body_s)\nVALUES ('Osage Hills State Park', 'Osage', '1, 100', '1936', '');\n\nGiven that the task is to update specific information in the 'Actress Filmography' table, this workflow is designed to modify the year and notes of a film.\n[step 1 description with {film_title} placeholder]\n[step 2 description with {new_year} and {new_notes} placeholders]\n\n1. Identify the row in the 'Actress Filmography' table where the `Title` is `{film_title}`.\n2. Update the `Year` and `Notes` columns of the identified row to `{new_year}` and `{new_notes}`, respectively.\n\nUpdate the name in the 'Name' column where 'Rank' is 'Men', 'Nationality' is 'Russia', and 'Time' is for the 200m backstroke\n"
