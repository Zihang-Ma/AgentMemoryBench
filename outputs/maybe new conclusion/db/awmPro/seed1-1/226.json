I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

Insert the new transfer record with values ['8', 'MF', 'Andrés Iniesta', 'Vissel Kobe', 'Transfer fee: $30 million', 'In 2018'] into the transfers table.\n\nGiven that the task is to update the points of a specific team in the standings table, this workflow automates the process.\n[step 1] Connect to the database where the standings table is located.\n[step 2] Execute an SQL update query to set the Points column to 6 for the row where Name is 'ESC Kempten II (N).'\n[step 3] Commit the changes and close the database connection.\n\nGiven that the task is to modify the 'Time/Retired' column for a specific driver in the 'Formula 1 Race Results' table, this workflow updates the 'Time/Retired' value for the driver 'Lewis Hamilton'.\n[step 1 description: Query the 'Formula 1 Race Results' table to find the row where 'Driver' is 'Lewis Hamilton'.]\n[step 2 description: Update the 'Time/Retired' column of the found row to '+1:30.763'.]\n\nUpdate the `Nationality` column of the row where `Recipient` is equal to `{person_name}` in the `speeches` table to `{new_nationality}`. Verify the update by checking if the `Nationality` of the row where `Recipient` is equal to `{person_name}` has been changed to `{new_nationality}`.\n\nGiven that the task involves querying a database table, this workflow extracts the correct table name from the provided headers.\n[step 1 description: Identify the correct table name from the headers]\nSELECT table_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE column_name = 'IATA'\n[step 2 description: Extract the table name]\nSELECT table_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE column_name = 'IATA'\n\nGiven that the user is querying a table that initially does not exist, this workflow checks for the table's existence and handles the case where it does not exist.\n[step 1] Check if the table 'Maryland_State_Legislature_Representatives' exists.\n[step 2] If the table does not exist, return an error message indicating the table does not exist.\n"
