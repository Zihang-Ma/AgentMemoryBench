I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

Update the `Series`, `Races`, `Wins`, `Podiums`, `Points`, and `Final Placing` columns to `{series}`, `{races}`, `{wins}`, `{podiums}`, `{points}`, and `{final_placing}` respectively.\n\nGiven that the task is to filter surfaces from the Tennis Matches table, this workflow extracts the count of matches with a specific surface.\n[step 1 description with {surface_type} placeholder]\nSELECT COUNT(*) FROM Tennis_Matches WHERE Surface = \\'{surface_type}\\';\n[step 2 description with {surface_type} placeholder]\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Tournament) FROM Tennis_Matches WHERE Surface = \\'{surface_type}\\';\n\nInsert a new row into the \"Tour de France Winners by Stage\" table with the values: {year}, {stage}, {start_of_stage}, {distance_km}, {category_of_climb}, {stage_winner}, {nationality}, {yellow_jersey}, {bend}. Verify the insertion by checking if the new row with values {year}, {stage}, {start_of_stage}, {distance_km}, {category_of_climb}, {stage_winner}, {nationality}, {yellow_jersey}, {bend} exists in the table.\n\nGiven that the task is to modify the 'Time/Retired' column for a specific driver in the 'Formula 1 Race Results' table, this workflow updates the 'Time/Retired' value for the driver 'Lewis Hamilton'.\n[step 1 description: Query the 'Formula 1 Race Results' table to find the row where 'Driver' is 'Lewis Hamilton'.]\n[step 2 description: Update the 'Time/Retired' column of the found row to '+1:30.763'.]\n\nGiven that the user needs to query the total number of medals for specific nations from the Medal Table, this workflow constructs and executes the query.\n[step 1 description: Construct the query]\nSELECT SUM(Gold + Silver + Bronze) AS Total_Medals FROM Medal_Table WHERE Nation IN ('{nation1}', '{nation2}', '{nation3}', '{nation4}');\n[step 2 description: Execute the query]\nPREPARE stmt FROM query;\nEXECUTE stmt;\nDEALLOCATE PREPARE stmt;\n\nGiven that we need to find the average total score for a specific player with a specific finish, this workflow constructs and executes an SQL query to retrieve the required information.\n\n## step 1\nSELECT AVG(Total) AS Average_Total FROM {table_name} WHERE Player = '{player_name}' AND Finish = '{finish_position}';\n## step 2\nThe SQL query will be executed to return the average total score for the specified player with the given finish position.\n"
