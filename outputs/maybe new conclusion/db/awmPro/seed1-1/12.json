I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

Update the specified information for the player, such as height and current club, to {new_info} in the Basketball Players table.\n\nGiven that we need to update the stadium information for a specific team, this workflow updates the stadium and location details in the Team_Location_Stadium table.\n[step 1 description: Update the Stadium column for the specified Team to {stadium_name}]\n[step 2 description: Update the Location column for the specified Team to {location_city}]\nExample:\n- {stadium_name} = \\\"Ibrox Stadium\\\"\n- {location_city} = \\\"Glasgow\\\"\n\nGiven that the task involves querying a database table, this workflow extracts the correct table name from the provided headers.\n[step 1 description: Identify the correct table name from the headers]\nSELECT table_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE column_name = 'IATA'\n[step 2 description: Extract the table name]\nSELECT table_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE column_name = 'IATA'\n\nIdentify the row in the `racing_career` table where the `Season` is `{season}`. Update the `Series`, `Races`, `Wins`, `Podiums`, `Points`, and `Final Placing` columns to `{series}`, `{races}`, `{wins}`, `{podiums}`, `{points}`, and `{final_placing}` respectively.\n\nIdentify the player to be updated, which in this case is {player_name}. Update the player's height to {height} and current club to {current_club} in the Basketball Players table.\n\nGiven that the task is to add a new record to the Medalists table with specific details, this workflow inserts a new entry into the table.\n[step 1 description with {name}, {sport}, and {event} placeholders]\nINSERT INTO Medalists (Name, Sport, Event) VALUES ('{name}', '{sport}', '{event}');\n[step 2 description with {name}, {sport}, and {event} placeholders]\nVerify the insertion by selecting the newly added record.\nSELECT * FROM Medalists WHERE Name = '{name}' AND Sport = '{sport}' AND Event = '{event}';\n"
