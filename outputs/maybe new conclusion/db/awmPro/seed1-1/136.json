I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

Prepare the data to be inserted: {year}, {title}, {role}, and {notes}.\n2. Execute the SQL insert statement: INSERT INTO Movie_Credits (Year, Title, Role, Notes) VALUES ('{year}', '{title}', '{role}', '{notes}');\n\nGiven that the task is to update specific columns in the Filmography table based on a condition, this workflow sets the Notes column to 'Released' and the Role column to 'Todd' for rows where the Title column matches a specific value.\n\nGiven that you need to add a new record to an existing table using an INSERT INTO command, this workflow provides a structured approach to performing the insertion.\n\n[step 1 description with {year}, {title}, and {role} placeholders]\nINSERT INTO Table_of_Year_Title_and_Role (Year, Title, Role) VALUES ({year}, {title}, {role});\n\n[step 2 description with {year}, {title}, and {role} placeholders]\nVerify the insertion by selecting the newly added record:\nSELECT * FROM Table_of_Year_Title_and_Role WHERE Year = {year} AND Title = {title} AND Role = {role};\n\nFilter the rows in the {table_name} where the 'US air date' column matches the {date}. For each episode in the filtered {table_name}, retrieve the 'Rating', 'Share', 'Rating/Share (18–49)', and 'Viewers (millions)' columns and return a summary of these details.\n\nGiven that the task is to find an episode based on the director and its position in the season, this workflow constructs and executes a SQL query to retrieve the required information.\n[step 1 description with {variable} placeholders]\nSELECT Title, No. in season, No. in series, Original air date, Production code, U.S. viewers (millions), Written by \nFROM episode_table \nWHERE `Directed by` = '{director_name}' AND `No. in season` < {episode_season}\n[step 2 description with {variable} placeholders]\nExecute the constructed SQL query and return the results.\n\nIdentify the row in the `racing_career` table where the `Season` is `{season}`. Update the `Series`, `Races`, `Wins`, `Podiums`, `Points`, and `Final Placing` columns to `{series}`, `{races}`, `{wins}`, `{podiums}`, `{points}`, and `{final_placing}` respectively.\n\nGiven that the task is to insert a new record into the 'Athlete Results' table, this workflow specifies the process of adding a new entry with specific details.\n[step 1 description with {year}, {competition}, {venue}, {position}, {event}, {notes} placeholders]\n[step 2 description with {year}, {competition}, {venue}, {position}, {event}, {notes} placeholders]\n"
