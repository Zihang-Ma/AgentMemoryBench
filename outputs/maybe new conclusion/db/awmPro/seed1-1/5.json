I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

Update the specified information for the player, such as height and current club, to {new_info} in the Basketball Players table.\n\nUpdate the NBA Playoff History table for the Los Angeles Clippers. [step 1 description with {team_name} and {seasons_since_win} placeholders] - Update the 'Team' column to {team_name} and the 'Seasons since win' column to {seasons_since_win} in the NBA Playoff History table. [step 2 description with {last_series_win} and {losing_streak} placeholders] - Update the 'Last series win in NBA Playoffs' column to {last_series_win} and the 'Losing streak' column to {losing_streak} in the NBA Playoff History table. [step 3 description with {series_losses_teams} placeholder] - Update the 'Series losses - teams' column to include {series_losses_teams} in the NBA Playoff History table.\n\nGiven that the provided column names do not match the expected table schema, this workflow checks and corrects the column names.\nVerify the column names against the table schema\nif column_names != expected_column_names:\n    column_names = expected_column_names\n\nInsert data into the table with corrected column names\n\\ndata = [('Pelister', '1-3', 'Akademija Pandev', '0-1', '1-2')]\nquery = f\"INSERT INTO Football Match Results ({', '.join(column_names)}) VALUES ({', '.join(['%s'] * len(data[0]))})\"\nexecute_query(query, data)\n\nIdentify the player to be updated, which in this case is {player_name}. Update the player's height to {height} and current club to {current_club} in the Basketball Players table.\n\nIdentify the row in the `racing_career` table where the `Season` is `{season}`. Update the `Series`, `Races`, `Wins`, `Podiums`, `Points`, and `Final Placing` columns to `{series}`, `{races}`, `{wins}`, `{podiums}`, `{points}`, and `{final_placing}` respectively.\n\nGiven that the task involves querying a database table, this workflow extracts the correct table name from the provided headers.\n[step 1 description: Identify the correct table name from the headers]\nSELECT table_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE column_name = 'IATA'\n[step 2 description: Extract the table name]\nSELECT table_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE column_name = 'IATA'\n"
