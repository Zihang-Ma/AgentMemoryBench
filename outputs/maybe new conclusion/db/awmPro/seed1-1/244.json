I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

Verify the update by checking if the `Nationality` of the row where `Recipient` is equal to `{person_name}` has been changed to `{new_nationality}`.\n\nGiven that the table does not exist and column names need to be adjusted, this workflow creates the necessary table with correct column names.\n[step 1 description: Create the table with the correct column names]\nCREATE TABLE State_Parks_Table (\n    Park_Name TEXT,\n    County_or_Counties TEXT,\n    Area_in_acres TEXT,\n    Year_Established TEXT,\n    Water_Body_s TEXT\n);\n[step 2 description: Insert the new park information into the table]\nINSERT INTO State_Parks_Table (Park_Name, County_or_Counties, Area_in_acres, Year_Established, Water_Body_s)\nVALUES ('Osage Hills State Park', 'Osage', '1, 100', '1936', '');\n\nGiven that the task is to change the Notes for a specific entry in the athlete_high_jump_records table, this workflow updates the Notes field.\n[step 1 description: Query the database to find the entry with the specified Year, Competition, and Event]\nSELECT * FROM athlete_high_jump_records WHERE Year = 2009 AND Competition = 'World Championships' AND Event = 'High Jump';\n[step 2 description: Update the Notes field for the found entry]\nUPDATE athlete_high_jump_records SET Notes = '2.40 m' WHERE Year = 2009 AND Competition = 'World Championships' AND Event = 'High Jump';\n\nIdentify the row in the Hotels table where the Hotel column matches \\{hotel_name\\}. Update the Notes column of the identified row to \\{new_notes\\}.\n\nIdentify the row in the `racing_career` table where the `Season` is `{season}`. Update the `Series`, `Races`, `Wins`, `Podiums`, `Points`, and `Final Placing` columns to `{series}`, `{races}`, `{wins}`, `{podiums}`, `{points}`, and `{final_placing}` respectively.\n\nIdentify the player to be updated, which is {player_name}. Update the specified information for the player, such as height and current club, to {new_info} in the Basketball Players table.\n\nGiven that the task is to update a specific record in the 'Great Lakes Metropolitan Areas Population and Lakes' table based on the 'Rank' column, this workflow updates the 'Lake(s)' column.\n1. Identify the row in the table {table_name} where the Rank is equal to {rank}.\n2. Update the Lake(s) column of the identified row to {lake}.\n\nGiven that the task is to modify the 'Time/Retired' column for a specific driver in the 'Formula 1 Race Results' table, this workflow updates the 'Time/Retired' value for the driver 'Lewis Hamilton'.\n[step 1 description: Query the 'Formula 1 Race Results' table to find the row where 'Driver' is 'Lewis Hamilton'.]\n[step 2 description: Update the 'Time/Retired' column of the found row to '+1:30.763'.]\n"
