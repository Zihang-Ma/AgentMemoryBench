I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

Prepare the data to be inserted: {year}, {title}, {role}, and {notes}.\n2. Execute the SQL insert statement: INSERT INTO Movie_Credits (Year, Title, Role, Notes) VALUES ('{year}', '{title}', '{role}', '{notes}');\n\nGiven that the task is to set the notes to '-' for old films before 2010 in the filmography table, this workflow updates the table accordingly.\n[step 1 description with {table_name} and {year_column} placeholders]\n[step 2 description with {table_name}, {year_column}, and {notes_column} placeholders]\n\n1. Select all rows from the {table_name} where the value in the {year_column} is less than 2010.\n2. Update the {notes_column} to '-' for the selected rows.\n\nFilter the rows in the {table_name} where the 'US air date' column matches the {date}. For each episode in the filtered {table_name}, retrieve the 'Rating', 'Share', 'Rating/Share (18–49)', and 'Viewers (millions)' columns and return a summary of these details.\n\nUpdate the record in the Actress_Filmography table where Notes are set to '-' with the new values: Year = {year}, Title = {title}, Role = {role}, and Notes = {notes}. Verify the update by selecting the record with the new values to ensure the changes were applied correctly.\n\nGiven that the task is to find an episode based on the director and its position in the season, this workflow constructs and executes a SQL query to retrieve the required information.\n[step 1 description with {variable} placeholders]\nSELECT Title, No. in season, No. in series, Original air date, Production code, U.S. viewers (millions), Written by \nFROM episode_table \nWHERE `Directed by` = '{director_name}' AND `No. in season` < {episode_season}\n[step 2 description with {variable} placeholders]\nExecute the constructed SQL query and return the results.\n\nGiven that the task is to update a specific seat's series in the Seat Order Table, this workflow handles the necessary steps to perform the update.\n[step 1 description: Locate the row corresponding to the seat at position 6 from the right to the left in the Seat Order Table]\nlocate_row {seat_position: 6}\n[step 2 description: Update the `Series 1` column for the located row with `Hilary Devey`]\nupdate_series {row_index: {seat_position}, series: \\\"Series 1\\\", new_value: \\\"Hilary Devey\\\"}\n"
