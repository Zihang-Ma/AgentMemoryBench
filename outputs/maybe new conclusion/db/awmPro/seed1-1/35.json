The `GT numbers` column likely contains the count of GT numbers associated with each builder.\n\n2. **Query the Table**: We will query the table to find any builder with a `GT numbers` value greater than 7.\n\n3. **Return the Result**: Once we identify such a builder, we will return their name as the answer.\n\nNow, let's proceed with the first step: querying the table to find the builder with more than 7 GT numbers.",
