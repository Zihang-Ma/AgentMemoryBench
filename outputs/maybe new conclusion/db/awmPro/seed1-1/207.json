I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

Update the `Series`, `Races`, `Wins`, `Podiums`, `Points`, and `Final Placing` columns to `{series}`, `{races}`, `{wins}`, `{podiums}`, `{points}`, and `{final_placing}` respectively.\n\nCreate a table named Rankings with the following columns:\\n- Rank (text)\\n- Member Association (text)\\n- Points (text)\\n- Group stage (text)\\n- Play-off (text)\\n- AFC Cup (text)\\n\\nInsert the data into the Rankings table.\n\nFilter the rows in the {table_name} where the 'US air date' column matches the {date}. For each episode in the filtered {table_name}, retrieve the 'Rating', 'Share', 'Rating/Share (18–49)', and 'Viewers (millions)' columns and return a summary of these details.\n\nInsert a new row into the \"Tour de France Winners by Stage\" table with the values: {year}, {stage}, {start_of_stage}, {distance_km}, {category_of_climb}, {stage_winner}, {nationality}, {yellow_jersey}, {bend}. Verify the insertion by checking if the new row with values {year}, {stage}, {start_of_stage}, {distance_km}, {category_of_climb}, {stage_winner}, {nationality}, {yellow_jersey}, {bend} exists in the table.\n\nGiven that the task is to query a specific table for summing up goals, this workflow extracts the required data.\n[step 1 description with {player_name} placeholder] - Select the rows where the player name is {player_name}.\n[step 2 description with {player_name} and {total_goals} placeholders] - Sum up the values in the \"Total Goals\" column for the selected rows where the player name is {player_name} and return the total as {total_goals}.\n\nUpdate the NBA Playoff History table for the Los Angeles Clippers.

[step 3 description with {series_losses_teams} placeholder] - Update the 'Series losses - teams' column to include {series_losses_teams} in the NBA Playoff History table.\n\nGiven that the task is to insert game results into the game_results table, this workflow describes how to do it.\n[step 1 description with {date}, {opponent}, {score}, {loss}, {attendance}, {record} placeholders]\nINSERT INTO game_results (Date, Opponent, Score, Loss, Attendance, Record) VALUES ('{date}', '{opponent}', '{score}', '{loss}', '{attendance}', '{record}');\n[step 2 description with {values} placeholder]\nEXECUTE THE ABOVE SQL QUERY WITH VALUES = ('{date}', '{opponent}', '{score}', '{loss}', '{attendance}', '{record}');\n"
