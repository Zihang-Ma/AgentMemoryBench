I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

Ensure the record is added to the 'Library Locations' table named {table_name}.\n\nIdentify the row in the Hotels table where the Hotel column matches \\{hotel_name\\}. Update the Notes column of the identified row to \\{new_notes\\}.\n\nFind the row in the table `Tallest Buildings in Minneapolis` where the `Name` is 'Capella Tower' and update the `Floors` value in that row to '69'\n\nLocate the row in the {table_name} where the {country} is \\\"Germany\\\". Set the value of the \\\"Shared elements\\\" column for that row to \\\"2\\\"\n\nCheck if the table 'dbbench_5120352a_dcdc_4485_abe9_8477fee948ed.table' exists.\nIf the table exists, update the 'Pos' and 'Name' columns to 'FW' and 'Yuji Senuma' respectively, where the 'No' column is equal to '20'. If the table does not exist, handle the non-existence appropriately.\n\nPrepare the SQL Insert Statement: Construct the SQL insert statement for the table 'Aerial Tramways and Cable Cars' with columns 'Name', 'Year built', 'Country', 'Town', 'Height', and 'Remarks'.\nExecute the Insert Statement: Execute the constructed SQL insert statement with the values 'Sugarloaf Mountain Cable Car', '1912', 'Brazil', 'Rio de Janeiro', '396 m', and 'One of the longest cable car rides in the world'.\n"
