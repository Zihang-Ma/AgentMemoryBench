I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

Update the `Series`, `Races`, `Wins`, `Podiums`, `Points`, and `Final Placing` columns to `{series}`, `{races}`, `{wins}`, `{podiums}`, `{points}`, and `{final_placing}` respectively.\n\nGiven that we need to update the stadium information for a specific team, this workflow updates the stadium and location details in the Team_Location_Stadium table.\n[step 1 description: Update the Stadium column for the specified Team to {stadium_name}]\n[step 2 description: Update the Location column for the specified Team to {location_city}]\nExample:\n- {stadium_name} = \\\"Ibrox Stadium\\\"\n- {location_city} = \\\"Glasgow\\\"\n\nGiven that the provided column names do not match the expected table schema, this workflow checks and corrects the column names.\nVerify the column names against the table schema\nif column_names != expected_column_names:\n    column_names = expected_column_names\n\nInsert data into the table with corrected column names\n\\ndata = [('Pelister', '1-3', 'Akademija Pandev', '0-1', '1-2')]\nquery = f\"INSERT INTO Football Match Results ({', '.join(column_names)}) VALUES ({', '.join(['%s'] * len(data[0]))})\"\nexecute_query(query, data)\n\nUpdate the row in the Game Statistics table where the Game column matches {game_id} with the new value for High points, which is {high_points}.\\nUpdate the same row in the Game Statistics table where the Game column matches {game_id} with the new value for High rebounds, which is {high_rebounds}.\n\nFrom the Soccer Team Performance Table, filter rows where the Team name is {team_name} and the League is not {excluded_league}.\\nExtract the League column values from the filtered rows.\n\nIdentify the player to be updated, which is {player_name}. Update the specified information for the player, such as height and current club, to {new_info} in the Basketball Players table.\n\nUpdate the NBA Playoff History table for the Los Angeles Clippers.
