I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

Identify the row in the {table_name} where the {religion} column corresponds to the specified {year}.\n2. Update the percentage value in the identified row to the new {new_percentage}.\n\nGiven that the task is to update the total points of a specific figure skating competitor in the 'Figure Skating Competitors' table, this workflow constructs and executes the correct SQL update statement.\n[step 1 description with {rank} and {new_total_points} placeholders]\nUPDATE `Figure Skating Competitors` SET `Total Points` = {new_total_points} WHERE `Rank` = {rank};\n[step 2 description with {rank} and {new_total_points} placeholders]\nVerify the update by selecting the row with the specified rank to ensure the total points have been updated to the new value.\nSELECT * FROM `Figure Skating Competitors` WHERE `Rank` = {rank};\n\nGiven that the task is to update a specific record in the 'Great Lakes Metropolitan Areas Population and Lakes' table based on the 'Rank' column, this workflow updates the 'Lake(s)' column.\n1. Identify the row in the table {table_name} where the Rank is equal to {rank}.\n2.
