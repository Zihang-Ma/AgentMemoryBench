I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

Execute the SQL query to update the rank of the specified airport.\n\nIdentify the country, province/state, city, and airport name to be added: {country} = 'Australia', {province_state} = 'New South Wales', {city} = 'Sydney', {airport_name} = 'Sydney Kingsford Smith International Airport'. Append the new entry to the table named {table_name}: 'Country': {country}, 'Province / State': {province_state}, 'City': {city}, 'Airport': {airport_name}.\n\nGiven that the task is to set the Total column to a specific value for rows matching a specific condition in the Nationality_Passengers_Crew_Total_Table, this workflow updates the Total column based on the provided condition.\n[step 1 description with {table_name} and {column_name} placeholders]\nUpdate the {column_name} column in the {table_name} table.\n[step 2 description with {condition_column}, {condition_value}, and {new_value} placeholders]\nSet the {column_name} column to {new_value} for rows where the {condition_column} column equals {condition_value}.\n\nGiven that the task is to update the Total column in the Nationality_Passengers_Crew_Total_Table based on a specific condition, this workflow updates the Total column to a specified value for rows matching a given condition.\n[step 1 description with {table_name} and {column_name} placeholders]\nUpdate the {column_name} column in the {table_name} table.\n[step 2 description with {condition_column}, {condition_value}, and {new_value} placeholders]\nSet the {column_name} column to {new_value} for rows where the {condition_column} column equals {condition_value}.\n\nGiven that the task is to update a specific record in the 'Great Lakes Metropolitan Areas Population and Lakes' table based on the 'Rank' column, this workflow updates the 'Lake(s)' column.\n1. Identify the row in the table {table_name} where the Rank is equal to {rank}.\n2.
