I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

[step 1 description with {team_name} and {seasons_since_win} placeholders] - Update the 'Team' column to {team_name} and the 'Seasons since win' column to {seasons_since_win} in the NBA Playoff History table. [step 2 description with {last_series_win} and {losing_streak} placeholders] - Update the 'Last series win in NBA Playoffs' column to {last_series_win} and the 'Losing streak' column to {losing_streak} in the NBA Playoff History table. [step 3 description with {series_losses_teams} placeholder] - Update the 'Series losses - teams' column to include {series_losses_teams} in the NBA Playoff History table.\n\nCreate a table named Rankings with the following columns:\\n- Rank (text)\\n- Member Association (text)\\n- Points (text)\\n- Group stage (text)\\n- Play-off (text)\\n- AFC Cup (text)\\n\\nInsert the data into the Rankings table.\n\nIdentify the player to be updated, which is {player_name}. Update the specified information for the player, such as height and current club, to {new_info} in the Basketball Players table.\n\nGiven that we need to find the average total score for a specific player with a specific finish, this workflow constructs and executes an SQL query to retrieve the required information.\n\n## step 1\nSELECT AVG(Total) AS Average_Total FROM {table_name} WHERE Player = '{player_name}' AND Finish = '{finish_position}';\n## step 2\nThe SQL query will be executed to return the average total score for the specified player with the given finish position.\n\nIdentify the player to be updated, which in this case is {player_name}. Update the player's height to {height} and current club to {current_club} in the Basketball Players table.\n\nReplace 'Away_team_score' with 'Away team score' in the query\\n\\nUPDATE query SET column_name = REPLACE(column_name, 'Away_team_score', 'Away team score')\\n\\nEXECUTE query\n"
