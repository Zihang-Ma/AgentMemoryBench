I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

Update the `Series`, `Races`, `Wins`, `Podiums`, `Points`, and `Final Placing` columns to `{series}`, `{races}`, `{wins}`, `{podiums}`, `{points}`, and `{final_placing}` respectively.\n\nInsert a new row into the \"Tour de France Winners by Stage\" table with the values: {year}, {stage}, {start_of_stage}, {distance_km}, {category_of_climb}, {stage_winner}, {nationality}, {yellow_jersey}, {bend}. Verify the insertion by checking if the new row with values {year}, {stage}, {start_of_stage}, {distance_km}, {category_of_climb}, {stage_winner}, {nationality}, {yellow_jersey}, {bend} exists in the table.\n\nCreate a table named Rankings with the following columns:\\n- Rank (text)\\n- Member Association (text)\\n- Points (text)\\n- Group stage (text)\\n- Play-off (text)\\n- AFC Cup (text)\\n\\nInsert the data into the Rankings table.\n\nGiven that the table headers are provided, this workflow ensures the correct headers are used in the query.\n[step 1] Verify the table name is 'Movies'.\n[step 2] Confirm the headers match the provided list: ['Year', 'Title', 'Role', 'Director', 'Notes'].\n\nGiven that the user provides the name and headers of a table, this workflow fetches the table information and retrieves the earliest game with a specific score.\n[step 1: Fetch table headers and name]\nDESCRIBE `Game Results`;\n[step 2: Query for the earliest game with a score of 99-89]\nSELECT * FROM `Game Results` WHERE Score = '99-89' ORDER BY Date ASC LIMIT 1;\n\nGiven that the task is to change the Notes for a specific entry in the athlete_high_jump_records table, this workflow updates the Notes field.\n[step 1 description: Query the database to find the entry with the specified Year, Competition, and Event]\nSELECT * FROM athlete_high_jump_records WHERE Year = 2009 AND Competition = 'World Championships' AND Event = 'High Jump';\n[step 2 description: Update the Notes field for the found entry]\nUPDATE athlete_high_jump_records SET Notes = '2.40 m' WHERE Year = 2009 AND Competition = 'World Championships' AND Event = 'High Jump';\n\nGiven that the task involves updating specific medal counts in the Olympic Medal Table, this workflow updates the bronze count and total count for a given nation.\n[step 1 description with {nation} placeholder] Identify the row in the Olympic Medal Table where the nation is {nation}.\n[step 2 description with {nation} and {bronze_count} placeholders] Update the bronze count for {nation} to {bronze_count}.\n[step 3 description with {nation} and {total_count} placeholders] Increment the total count for {nation} by 1.\n[step 4 description] Save the changes to the Olympic Medal Table.\n"
