I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

      "content": "Here are some examples of the task you have completed:\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is racers_database, and the headers of this table are Year,Entrant,Chassis,Engine,Points.\nQuestion: What is the average year that the Belanger Motors had an Offenhauser l4 engine?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Year FROM racers_database WHERE Entrant = 'Belanger Motors' AND Engine = 'Offenhauser l4';\"}) To find the average year that \"Belanger Motors\" had an \"Offenhauser L4\" engine, I need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. Filter the records in the `racers_database` table where the `Entrant` is \"Belanger Motors\" and the `Engine` is \"Offenhauser L4\".\n2. Calculate the average of the `Year` column for these filtered records.\n\nI will start by querying the years for which \"Belanger Motors\" had an \"Offenhauser L4\" engine.\nTool: [('1956',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"1956\"]}) The query returned a single year, 1956. Since there is only one record, the average year is the same as that record. \n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Racing Stats, and the headers of this table are Year,Starts,Wins,Top 5,Top 10,Poles,Avg. Start,Avg. Finish,Winnings,Position,Team(s).\nQuestion: Name the avg finish for position of 70th\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Avg. Finish` FROM Racing_Stats WHERE Position = 70;\"})\nTool: 1146 (42S02): Table 'dbbench_5f357b69_3ae3_4047_891d_a76014087886.Racing_Stats' doesn't exist\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Avg. Finish` FROM `Racing Stats` WHERE Position = 70;\"})\nTool: [('36.0',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"36.0\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Aerial Tramways and Cable Cars, and the headers of this table are Name,Year built,Country,Town,Height,Remarks.\nQuestion: Inserção na tabela \"Aerial Tramways and Cable Cars\" dos valores para colunas \"Name\", \"Year built\", \"Country\", \"Town\", \"Height\" e \"Remarks\", respectivamente, 'Sugarloaf Mountain Cable Car', '1912', 'Brazil', 'Rio de Janeiro', '396 m' e 'One of the longest cable car rides in the world'.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `Aerial Tramways and Cable Cars` (Name, `Year built`, Country, Town, Height, Remarks) VALUES ('Sugarloaf Mountain Cable Car', '1912', 'Brazil', 'Rio de Janeiro', '396 m', 'One of the longest cable car rides in the world');\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The values 'Sugarloaf Mountain Cable Car', '1912', 'Brazil', 'Rio de Janeiro', '396 m', and 'One of the longest cable car rides in the world' have been inserted into the 'Aerial Tramways and Cable Cars' table.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is highest_points, and the headers of this table are Rank,Country,Claimant,Highest point,Height.\nQuestion: What is the highest amount of points for rank 95?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Highest point` FROM highest_points WHERE Rank = 95;\"}) To find the highest amount of points for rank 95 in the `highest_points` table, I need to query the `Highest point` column where the `Rank` is 95. I will execute a SQL query to achieve this.\nTool: 1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near '= 95' at line 1\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Highest point` FROM highest_points WHERE `Rank` = 95;\"}) The SQL query had a syntax error because the column name `Rank` contains a reserved keyword in MySQL. To fix this, I will enclose the column name in backticks to ensure it is treated as a regular column name. I will re-execute the query with the corrected syntax.\nTool: [('Đeravica',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Đeravica\"]}) The SQL query returned the result `Đeravica`, which is the highest amount of points for rank 95. I will now commit the final answer."
