I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

Then, I can compute the average using SQL.\n\nI will start by querying the gold medals for these three nations.\nTool: [('13',), ('7',), ('1',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"7\"]}) The SQL query returned the number of gold medals for China, Japan, and North Korea as 13, 7, and 1 respectively. To find the average, I will now calculate the mean of these three values.\n\nThe average number of gold medals is (13 + 7 + 1) / 3 = 21 / 3 = 7.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Figure Skating Competitors, and the headers of this table are Rank,Name,Nation,Total Points,SP,FS.\nQuestion: Update the total points of the figure skating competitor ranked 22 to 195.67 in the 'Figure Skating Competitors' table.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Figure Skating Competitors` SET `Total Points` = 195.67 WHERE Rank = 22;\"})\nTool: 1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near '= 22' at line 1\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Figure Skating Competitors` SET `Total Points` = 195.67 WHERE Rank = '22';\"})\nTool: 1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near '= '22'' at line 1\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Figure Skating Competitors` SET `Total Points` = 195.67 WHERE Rank = 22;\"})\nTool: 1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near '= 22' at line 1\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Figure Skating Competitors` SET `Total Points` = 195.67 WHERE `Rank` = 22;\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The total points of the figure skating competitor ranked 22 have been updated to 195.67 in the 'Figure Skating Competitors' table.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Athlete Performances, and the headers of this table are Year,Competition,Venue,Position,Event,Notes.\nQuestion: Insert a record into the table 'Athlete Performances' with the values '1996' for the year, 'Olympic Games' for the competition, 'Atlanta, USA' for the venue, '1st' for the position, 'Decathlon' for the event, and '8893 pts' for the notes.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO Athlete_Performances (Year, Competition, Venue, Position, Event, Notes) VALUES ('1996', 'Olympic Games', 'Atlanta, USA', '1st', 'Decathlon', '8893 pts');\"})\nTool: 1146 (42S02): Table 'dbbench_f3330e2b_67a7_4c79_81d0_cdc2881883be.Athlete_Performances' doesn't exist\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `Athlete Performances` (Year, Competition, Venue, Position, Event, Notes) VALUES ('1996', 'Olympic Games', 'Atlanta, USA', '1st', 'Decathlon', '8893 pts');\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The record has been inserted into the 'Athlete Performances' table as specified.\"]})"
