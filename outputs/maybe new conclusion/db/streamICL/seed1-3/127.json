I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

Set the year to '1998', competition to 'Commonwealth Games', venue to 'Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia', position to '1st', and notes to '8:37.92'.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE athlete_performance SET Year = '1998', Competition = 'Commonwealth Games', Venue = 'Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia', Position = '1st', Notes = '8:37.92' WHERE Event = '3000 m' AND Position = '2nd';\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The athlete's performance data for the '3000 m' event where the athlete finished in '2nd' position has been updated as specified.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Olympic Medals, and the headers of this table are Rank,Nation,Gold,Silver,Bronze,Total.\nQuestion: what is the average number of gold medals won by china, japan, and north korea?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Gold FROM `Olympic Medals` WHERE Nation IN ('China', 'Japan', 'North Korea');\"}) To calculate the average number of gold medals won by China, Japan, and North Korea, I need to first retrieve the number of gold medals for each of these nations from the `Olympic Medals` table. Then, I can compute the average using SQL.\n\nI will start by querying the gold medals for these three nations.\nTool: [('13',), ('7',), ('1',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"7\"]}) The SQL query returned the number of gold medals for China, Japan, and North Korea as 13, 7, and 1 respectively. To find the average, I will now calculate the mean of these three values.\n\nThe average number of gold medals is (13 + 7 + 1) / 3 = 21 / 3 = 7.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Olympic Medal Table, and the headers of this table are Rank,Nation,Gold,Silver,Bronze,Total.\nQuestion: Japan's Olympic Medal Table has been updated with 2 Gold, 5 Silver, 4 Bronze and a total of 11 medals.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Olympic Medal Table` SET Gold = 2, Silver = 5, Bronze = 4, Total = 11 WHERE Nation = 'Japan';\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Japan's Olympic Medal Table has been updated with 2 Gold, 5 Silver, 4 Bronze and a total of 11 medals.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Player Goals in International Tournaments, and the headers of this table are Player,Friendlies,FIFA Confederations Cup,FIFA World Cup Qual.,Total Goals.\nQuestion: add up the total number of goals scored by chipperfield and viduka.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Total Goals` FROM `Player Goals in International Tournaments` WHERE Player = 'Chipperfield';\"}) To calculate the total number of goals scored by Chipperfield and Viduka, I need to query the `Player Goals in International Tournaments` table for the `Total Goals` of each player and then sum them up. I will first retrieve the `Total Goals` for Chipperfield and Viduka individually. \n\nI will start by retrieving the `Total Goals` for Chipperfield.\nTool: [('2',)]\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Total Goals` FROM `Player Goals in International Tournaments` WHERE Player = 'Viduka';\"}) The SQL query returned a result of `2` for Chipperfield's total goals. Now, I will retrieve the `Total Goals` for Viduka.\nTool: [('3',)]\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT (SELECT `Total Goals` FROM `Player Goals in International Tournaments` WHERE Player = 'Chipperfield') + (SELECT `Total Goals` FROM `Player Goals in International Tournaments` WHERE Player = 'Viduka') AS Total;\"}) The SQL query returned a result of `3` for Viduka's total goals.
