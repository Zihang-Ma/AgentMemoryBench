I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

I will execute a SQL query to achieve this.\nTool: [(167.0,)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"167.0\"]}) The SQL query returned the result `167.0`, which is the total pick number for players in the D position from the Chilliwack Bruins team. I will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Football Matches, and the headers of this table are Tie no,Home team,Score,Away team,Attendance.\nQuestion: How many attended tie number 19?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Attendance FROM `Football Matches` WHERE Tie no = 19;\"})\nTool: 1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near 'no = 19' at line 1\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Attendance FROM `Football Matches` WHERE `Tie no` = 19;\"})\nTool: [('1,174',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"1,174\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is football_matches, and the headers of this table are Home team,Home team score,Away team,Away team score,Venue,Crowd,Date.\nQuestion: What is the smallest crowd number for a team that has an Away team score of 15.11 (101)?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Crowd FROM football_matches WHERE `Away team score` = '15.11 (101)';\"}) The question asks for the smallest crowd number for a team where the away team's score is 15.11 (101). To answer this, I will first query the `football_matches` table to find all matches where the `Away team score` is 15.11 (101), and then determine the minimum `Crowd` value from those matches.\n\nI will start by retrieving the relevant matches.\nTool: [('16,000',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"16,000\"]}) The SQL query returned a single result: `16,000`. This is the smallest crowd number for a team with an away team score of 15.11 (101), as there is only one match with that score.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Schools Information, and the headers of this table are School,Gender,Age Range,Religious Affiliation,Location,School website.\nQuestion: How many schools have a website of http://www.camp.herts.sch.uk/?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `Schools Information` WHERE `School website` = 'http://www.camp.herts.sch.uk/';\"}) To answer the question, I need to count the number of schools in the `Schools Information` table that have a `School website` of `http://www.camp.herts.sch.uk/`. I will execute a SQL query to count the rows where the `School website` matches the given URL.\nTool: [(1,)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"1\"]})"
