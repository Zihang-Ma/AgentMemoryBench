I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

      "content": "Here are some examples of the task you have completed:\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Olympic Medal Table, and the headers of this table are Rank,Nation,Gold,Silver,Bronze,Total.\nQuestion: Japan's Olympic Medal Table has been updated with 2 Gold, 5 Silver, 4 Bronze and a total of 11 medals.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Olympic Medal Table` SET Gold = 2, Silver = 5, Bronze = 4, Total = 11 WHERE Nation = 'Japan';\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Japan's Olympic Medal Table has been updated with 2 Gold, 5 Silver, 4 Bronze and a total of 11 medals.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is athlete_performance, and the headers of this table are Year,Competition,Venue,Position,Event,Notes.\nQuestion: Update the athlete's performance data in the 'athlete_performance' table for the '3000 m' event where the athlete finished in '2nd' position. Set the year to '1998', competition to 'Commonwealth Games', venue to 'Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia', position to '1st', and notes to '8:37.92'.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE athlete_performance SET Year = '1998', Competition = 'Commonwealth Games', Venue = 'Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia', Position = '1st', Notes = '8:37.92' WHERE Event = '3000 m' AND Position = '2nd';\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The athlete's performance data for the '3000 m' event where the athlete finished in '2nd' position has been updated as specified.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is hockey_players, and the headers of this table are Pick #,Player,Nationality,Position,Team from,League from.\nQuestion: What is the total pick # for the D position from a team from Chilliwack Bruins?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT SUM(`Pick #`) FROM hockey_players WHERE Position = 'D' AND `Team from` = 'Chilliwack Bruins';\"}) To find the total pick # for the D position from a team from Chilliwack Bruins, I need to query the `hockey_players` table for all rows where the `Position` is \"D\" and the `Team from` is \"Chilliwack Bruins\", and then sum the values in the `Pick #` column. I will execute a SQL query to achieve this.\nTool: [(167.0,)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"167.0\"]}) The SQL query returned the result `167.0`, which is the total pick number for players in the D position from the Chilliwack Bruins team. I will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Olympic Medals, and the headers of this table are Rank,Nation,Gold,Silver,Bronze,Total.\nQuestion: what is the average number of gold medals won by china, japan, and north korea?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Gold FROM `Olympic Medals` WHERE Nation IN ('China', 'Japan', 'North Korea');\"}) To calculate the average number of gold medals won by China, Japan, and North Korea, I need to first retrieve the number of gold medals for each of these nations from the `Olympic Medals` table. Then, I can compute the average using SQL.\n\nI will start by querying the gold medals for these three nations.\nTool: [('13',), ('7',), ('1',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"7\"]}) The SQL query returned the number of gold medals for China, Japan, and North Korea as 13, 7, and 1 respectively. To find the average, I will now calculate the mean of these three values.\n\nThe average number of gold medals is (13 + 7 + 1) / 3 = 21 / 3 = 7.\n\nI will now commit the final answer."
