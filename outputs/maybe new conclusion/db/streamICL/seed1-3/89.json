I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

The association with the highest `Joining year` is the one that entered last. I will execute a SQL query to retrieve this information.\nTool: [('Northern Mariana Islands',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Northern Mariana Islands\"]}) The association that entered last is 'Northern Mariana Islands'. I will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Jiu-Jitsu Championships Results, and the headers of this table are Result,Opponent,Method,Event,Notes.\nQuestion: What are the Notes when the Method is decision?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Notes FROM `Jiu-Jitsu Championships Results` WHERE Method = 'decision';\"})\nTool: [('Women +60kg Bronze',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Women +60kg Bronze\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Tennis Matches, and the headers of this table are Outcome,Date,Tournament,Surface,Partnering,Opponent in the final,Score in the final.\nQuestion: how many surfaces are grass?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `Tennis Matches` WHERE Surface = 'grass';\"}) To determine how many surfaces are grass in the `Tennis Matches` table, I need to count the number of rows where the `Surface` column is equal to 'grass'. I will execute a SQL query to achieve this.\nTool: [(2,)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"2\"]}) The SQL query returned a result of `2`. This indicates that there are 2 matches played on a grass surface in the `Tennis Matches` table. I will now commit the final answer."
