I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

      "content": "Here are some examples of the task you have completed:\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Racing Stats, and the headers of this table are Year,Starts,Wins,Top 5,Top 10,Poles,Avg. Start,Avg. Finish,Winnings,Position,Team(s).\nQuestion: Name the avg finish for position of 70th\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Avg. Finish` FROM Racing_Stats WHERE Position = 70;\"})\nTool: 1146 (42S02): Table 'dbbench_5f357b69_3ae3_4047_891d_a76014087886.Racing_Stats' doesn't exist\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Avg. Finish` FROM `Racing Stats` WHERE Position = 70;\"})\nTool: [('36.0',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"36.0\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is tennis_results, and the headers of this table are Year,Tournament,Surface,Round,Winner,Score.\nQuestion: What is Round, when Winner is \"Ivanovic\", when Year is less than 2008, and when Tournament is \"Paris\"?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Round FROM tennis_results WHERE Winner = 'Ivanovic' AND Year < 2008 AND Tournament = 'Paris';\"}) To answer the question, I need to retrieve the `Round` from the `tennis_results` table where the `Winner` is \"Ivanovic\", the `Year` is less than 2008, and the `Tournament` is \"Paris\". I will execute a SQL query to filter the records based on these conditions and select the required column.\nTool: [('QF',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"QF\"]}) The SQL query returned a result of `('QF',)`. This indicates that the round when \"Ivanovic\" won at the \"Paris\" tournament in a year less than 2008 is \"QF\". I will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Tennis Matches, and the headers of this table are Outcome,Date,Tournament,Surface,Partnering,Opponent in the final,Score in the final.\nQuestion: how many surfaces are grass?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `Tennis Matches` WHERE Surface = 'grass';\"}) To determine how many surfaces are grass in the `Tennis Matches` table, I need to count the number of rows where the `Surface` column is equal to 'grass'. I will execute a SQL query to achieve this.\nTool: [(2,)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"2\"]}) The SQL query returned a result of `2`. This indicates that there are 2 matches played on a grass surface in the `Tennis Matches` table. I will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Winners By Country, and the headers of this table are Winner,Country,Most Recent Win.\nQuestion: The `Winners By Country` table is being updated by adding the values '3' for `Winner`, 'Spain' for `Country`, and '2005' for `Most Recent Win`.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `Winners By Country` (Winner, Country, `Most Recent Win`) VALUES ('3', 'Spain', '2005');\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The values '3' for `Winner`, 'Spain' for `Country`, and '2005' for `Most Recent Win` have been added to the `Winners By Country` table.\"]})"
