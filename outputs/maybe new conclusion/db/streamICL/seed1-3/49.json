I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

Then, I will retrieve the `Score` value for those games. I will execute a SQL query to achieve this.\nTool: [('L 97–98 (OT)',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"L 97–98 (OT)\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is game score, and the headers of this table are Game,Date,Opponent,Score,Location,Record.\nQuestion: Score of 108-85 is what lowest game?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Game FROM `game score` WHERE Score = '108-85';\"}) The question is asking for the lowest game number where the score was \"108-85\". To find this, I will query the `game score` table to retrieve the `Game` number for the row where the `Score` is \"108-85\" and then determine the minimum value of `Game` from that result. \n\nI will start by retrieving the game number(s) where the score is \"108-85\".\nTool: [('80',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"80\"]}) The SQL query returned the result `80`, which is the game number where the score was \"108-85\". Since the question asks for the lowest game number with that score, and there is only one such game, the answer is `80`.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Game Records, and the headers of this table are Game,February,Opponent,Score,Record.\nQuestion: Change the February record of Game 62 to 30 in the record database.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Game Records` SET `February` = 30 WHERE Game = 62;\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The February record for Game 62 has been updated to 30 in the Game Records table.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is football_standings, and the headers of this table are Position,Club,Games played,Wins,Draws,Loses,Goals scored,Goals conceded,Points.\nQuestion: What is the fewest number of games played?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT MIN(`Games played`) AS FewestGames FROM football_standings;\"}) To find the fewest number of games played, I need to query the `football_standings` table and retrieve the minimum value of the `Games played` column. I will execute a SQL query to achieve this.\nTool: [('34',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"34\"]}) The SQL query returned the result `34`, which is the fewest number of games played. I will now commit the final answer."
