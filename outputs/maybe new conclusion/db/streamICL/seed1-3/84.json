I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

      "content": "Here are some examples of the task you have completed:\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Music Releases, and the headers of this table are Release,Artist,Title,Notes,Album.\nQuestion: what year was the first title released?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT MIN(Release) FROM `Music Releases`;\"}) To determine the year the first title was released, I need to find the minimum value in the `Release` column of the `Music Releases` table. I will execute a SQL query to retrieve this information.\nTool: 1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near 'Release) FROM `Music Releases`' at line 1\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT MIN(`Release`) FROM `Music Releases`;\"}) The error indicates that the column name `Release` is reserved or conflicting with a MySQL keyword. To resolve this, I will use backticks around the column name to ensure it is treated as a regular column name. I will execute the corrected SQL query to find the minimum release year.\nTool: [('2004',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"2004\"]}) The SQL query returned a result of `2004`. This indicates that the first title was released in the year 2004. I will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is US Music Charts, and the headers of this table are Year,US Billboard,US Cash Box,US AC,CAN AC,Title.\nQuestion: What is the US cash box before 1978 with a US billboard of 35?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `US Cash Box` FROM `US Music Charts` WHERE `US Billboard` = 35 AND Year < 1978;\"}) To answer the question, I need to find the value of the `US Cash Box` column for the row where the `US Billboard` is 35 and the `Year` is before 1978. I will execute a SQL query to retrieve this information.\nTool: [('18',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"18\"]}) The SQL query returned a result of `18`. This indicates that the `US Cash Box` value for the record with a `US Billboard` of 35 and a year before 1978 is 18. I will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Racing Stats, and the headers of this table are Year,Starts,Wins,Top 5,Top 10,Poles,Avg. Start,Avg. Finish,Winnings,Position,Team(s).\nQuestion: Name the avg finish for position of 70th\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Avg. Finish` FROM Racing_Stats WHERE Position = 70;\"})\nTool: 1146 (42S02): Table 'dbbench_5f357b69_3ae3_4047_891d_a76014087886.Racing_Stats' doesn't exist\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Avg. Finish` FROM `Racing Stats` WHERE Position = 70;\"})\nTool: [('36.0',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"36.0\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is highest_points, and the headers of this table are Rank,Country,Claimant,Highest point,Height.\nQuestion: What is the highest amount of points for rank 95?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Highest point` FROM highest_points WHERE Rank = 95;\"}) To find the highest amount of points for rank 95 in the `highest_points` table, I need to query the `Highest point` column where the `Rank` is 95. I will execute a SQL query to achieve this.\nTool: 1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near '= 95' at line 1\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Highest point` FROM highest_points WHERE `Rank` = 95;\"}) The SQL query had a syntax error because the column name `Rank` contains a reserved keyword in MySQL. To fix this, I will enclose the column name in backticks to ensure it is treated as a regular column name. I will re-execute the query with the corrected syntax.\nTool: [('Đeravica',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Đeravica\"]}) The SQL query returned the result `Đeravica`, which is the highest amount of points for rank 95. I will now commit the final answer."
