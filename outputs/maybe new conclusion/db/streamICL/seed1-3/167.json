I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

I will execute a SQL query to achieve this.\nTool: [('34',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"34\"]}) The SQL query returned the result `34`, which is the fewest number of games played. I will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Football Matches, and the headers of this table are Tie no,Home team,Score,Away team,Attendance.\nQuestion: How many attended tie number 19?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Attendance FROM `Football Matches` WHERE Tie no = 19;\"})\nTool: 1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near 'no = 19' at line 1\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Attendance FROM `Football Matches` WHERE `Tie no` = 19;\"})\nTool: [('1,174',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"1,174\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Football Teams, and the headers of this table are Association,Joining year,Men's team,Women's team,League.\nQuestion: which association entered last?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Association` FROM `Football Teams` WHERE `Joining year` = (SELECT MAX(`Joining year`) FROM `Football Teams`);\"}) To determine which association entered last, I need to find the maximum value in the `Joining year` column of the `Football Teams` table. The association with the highest `Joining year` is the one that entered last. I will execute a SQL query to retrieve this information.\nTool: [('Northern Mariana Islands',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Northern Mariana Islands\"]}) The association that entered last is 'Northern Mariana Islands'. I will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Football Match Results, and the headers of this table are Team 1,Agg.,Team 2,1st leg,2nd leg.\nQuestion: Insert the football match results into the 'Football Match Results' table with the following fields: 'Team 1', 'Agg.', 'Team 2', '1st leg', and '2nd leg' with corresponding values: 'Pelister', '1-3', 'Akademija Pandev', '0-1', '1-2'.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `Football Match Results` (`Team 1`, `Agg.`, `Team 2`, `1st leg`, `2nd leg`) VALUES ('Pelister', '1-3', 'Akademija Pandev', '0-1', '1-2');\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The football match results have been inserted into the 'Football Match Results' table as specified.\"]})"
