I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

I will first retrieve the positions of both drivers from the table. \n\nI will start by querying the position of Tony Maggs.\nTool: [('5',)]\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Pos FROM `Grand Prix Result` WHERE Driver = 'Jo Siffert';\"}) The position of Tony Maggs is 5. Now, I will query the position of Jo Siffert to compare.\nTool: [('11',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Tony Maggs\"]}) The position of Jo Siffert is 11. Comparing their positions, Tony Maggs came in earlier than Jo Siffert.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Basketball Players, and the headers of this table are No,Player,Height,Position,Year born,Current Club.\nQuestion: What is the earliest any of these players were born?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT MIN(`Year born`) FROM `Basketball Players`;\"}) To find the earliest birth year among the players in the `Basketball Players` table, I need to query the `Year born` column and retrieve the minimum value. I will execute a SQL query to achieve this.\nTool: [('1976',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"1976\"]}) The SQL query returned the result `1976`, which is the earliest year any of the players were born. I will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Commemorative Sculptures, and the headers of this table are Title / individual commemorated,Location,Date,Sculptor.\nQuestion: Change the date and sculptor of the 'Commemorative Sculptures' titled 'Mahatma Gandhi' to '1948' and 'Unknown' respectively.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Commemorative Sculptures` SET Date = '1948', Sculptor = 'Unknown' WHERE `Title / individual commemorated` = 'Mahatma Gandhi';\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The date and sculptor for the commemorative sculpture titled 'Mahatma Gandhi' have been successfully updated to '1948' and 'Unknown' respectively.\"]})"
