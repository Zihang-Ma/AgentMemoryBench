I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

I will execute a SQL query to achieve this.\nTool: [('1976',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"1976\"]}) The SQL query returned the result `1976`, which is the earliest year any of the players were born. I will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is game_results, and the headers of this table are Game,Date,Team,Score,Record,Streak.\nQuestion: To update the results of game 39, set the team to 'Miami Heat' in the game_results table.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE game_results SET Team = 'Miami Heat' WHERE Game = 39;\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The team for game 39 has been updated to 'Miami Heat' in the game_results table.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is hockey_players, and the headers of this table are Pick #,Player,Nationality,Position,Team from,League from.\nQuestion: What is the total pick # for the D position from a team from Chilliwack Bruins?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT SUM(`Pick #`) FROM hockey_players WHERE Position = 'D' AND `Team from` = 'Chilliwack Bruins';\"}) To find the total pick # for the D position from a team from Chilliwack Bruins, I need to query the `hockey_players` table for all rows where the `Position` is \"D\" and the `Team from` is \"Chilliwack Bruins\", and then sum the values in the `Pick #` column. I will execute a SQL query to achieve this.\nTool: [(167.0,)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"167.0\"]}) The SQL query returned the result `167.0`, which is the total pick number for players in the D position from the Chilliwack Bruins team.
