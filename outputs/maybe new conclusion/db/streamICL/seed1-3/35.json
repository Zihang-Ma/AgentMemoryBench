I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

I will execute a SQL query to achieve this.\nTool: [('27',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"27\"]}) The SQL query returned a single result: `27`. This is the number of league apps Ted Davis has. I will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is SWAT Games, and the headers of this table are Title,Year,Platform,Developer,Publisher.\nQuestion: Name the plaform for year more than 2006 and developer of 3g studios\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Platform FROM `SWAT Games` WHERE Year > 2006 AND Developer = '3g studios';\"}) To answer the question, I need to retrieve the `Platform` for games where the `Year` is greater than 2006 and the `Developer` is \"3g studios\". I will execute a SQL query to filter the records based on these conditions and select the required column.\nTool: [('PlayStation Portable',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"PlayStation Portable\"]}) The SQL query returned a result of `('PlayStation Portable',)`. This indicates that the platform for the game developed by \"3g studios\" in a year greater than 2006 is \"PlayStation Portable\". I will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Racing Stats, and the headers of this table are Year,Starts,Wins,Top 5,Top 10,Poles,Avg.
