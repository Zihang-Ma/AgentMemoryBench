I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

To answer this, I will first query the `football_matches` table to find all matches where the `Away team score` is 15.11 (101), and then determine the minimum `Crowd` value from those matches.\n\nI will start by retrieving the relevant matches.\nTool: [('16,000',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"16,000\"]}) The SQL query returned a single result: `16,000`. This is the smallest crowd number for a team with an away team score of 15.11 (101), as there is only one match with that score.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Olympic Medal Table, and the headers of this table are Rank,Nation,Gold,Silver,Bronze,Total.\nQuestion: Japan's Olympic Medal Table has been updated with 2 Gold, 5 Silver, 4 Bronze and a total of 11 medals.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Olympic Medal Table` SET Gold = 2, Silver = 5, Bronze = 4, Total = 11 WHERE Nation = 'Japan';\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Japan's Olympic Medal Table has been updated with 2 Gold, 5 Silver, 4 Bronze and a total of 11 medals.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is episode_table, and the headers of this table are No. in series,No. in season,Title,Directed by,Written by,Original air date,Production code,U.S. viewers (millions).\nQuestion: what is the name of the episode whose director is Michael Pressman and the number of that episode in that season is less than 10.0? \n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Title FROM episode_table WHERE `Directed by` = 'Michael Pressman' AND `No. in season` < 10.0;\"})\nTool: [('\"House of Cards\"',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"House of Cards\"]})"
