I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

I will execute a SQL query to achieve this.\nTool: [('34',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"34\"]}) The SQL query returned the result `34`, which is the fewest number of games played. I will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Athlete Results, and the headers of this table are Year,Competition,Venue,Position,Event,Notes.\nQuestion: In the `Athlete Results` table, add a new row with the following values: Year is '2018', Competition is 'Lisbon Half Marathon', Venue is 'Lisbon, Portugal', Position is '1st', Event is 'Half marathon' and Notes is '1:09:12'.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `Athlete Results` (Year, Competition, Venue, Position, Event, Notes) VALUES ('2018', 'Lisbon Half Marathon', 'Lisbon, Portugal', '1st', 'Half marathon', '1:09:12');\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The new row has been added to the `Athlete Results` table with the specified values.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is tennis_results, and the headers of this table are Year,Tournament,Surface,Round,Winner,Score.\nQuestion: What is Round, when Winner is \"Ivanovic\", when Year is less than 2008, and when Tournament is \"Paris\"?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Round FROM tennis_results WHERE Winner = 'Ivanovic' AND Year < 2008 AND Tournament = 'Paris';\"}) To answer the question, I need to retrieve the `Round` from the `tennis_results` table where the `Winner` is \"Ivanovic\", the `Year` is less than 2008, and the `Tournament` is \"Paris\". I will execute a SQL query to filter the records based on these conditions and select the required column.\nTool: [('QF',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"QF\"]}) The SQL query returned a result of `('QF',)`. This indicates that the round when \"Ivanovic\" won at the \"Paris\" tournament in a year less than 2008 is \"QF\". I will now commit the final answer."
