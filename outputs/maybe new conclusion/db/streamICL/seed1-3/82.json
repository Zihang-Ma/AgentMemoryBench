I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

      "content": "Here are some examples of the task you have completed:\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Football Teams, and the headers of this table are Association,Joining year,Men's team,Women's team,League.\nQuestion: which association entered last?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Association` FROM `Football Teams` WHERE `Joining year` = (SELECT MAX(`Joining year`) FROM `Football Teams`);\"}) To determine which association entered last, I need to find the maximum value in the `Joining year` column of the `Football Teams` table. The association with the highest `Joining year` is the one that entered last. I will execute a SQL query to retrieve this information.\nTool: [('Northern Mariana Islands',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Northern Mariana Islands\"]}) The association that entered last is 'Northern Mariana Islands'. I will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Football Matches, and the headers of this table are Tie no,Home team,Score,Away team,Attendance.\nQuestion: How many attended tie number 19?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Attendance FROM `Football Matches` WHERE Tie no = 19;\"})\nTool: 1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near 'no = 19' at line 1\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Attendance FROM `Football Matches` WHERE `Tie no` = 19;\"})\nTool: [('1,174',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"1,174\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Music Releases, and the headers of this table are Release,Artist,Title,Notes,Album.\nQuestion: what year was the first title released?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT MIN(Release) FROM `Music Releases`;\"}) To determine the year the first title was released, I need to find the minimum value in the `Release` column of the `Music Releases` table. I will execute a SQL query to retrieve this information.\nTool: 1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near 'Release) FROM `Music Releases`' at line 1\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT MIN(`Release`) FROM `Music Releases`;\"}) The error indicates that the column name `Release` is reserved or conflicting with a MySQL keyword. To resolve this, I will use backticks around the column name to ensure it is treated as a regular column name. I will execute the corrected SQL query to find the minimum release year.\nTool: [('2004',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"2004\"]}) The SQL query returned a result of `2004`. This indicates that the first title was released in the year 2004. I will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Aerial Tramways and Cable Cars, and the headers of this table are Name,Year built,Country,Town,Height,Remarks.\nQuestion: Inserção na tabela \"Aerial Tramways and Cable Cars\" dos valores para colunas \"Name\", \"Year built\", \"Country\", \"Town\", \"Height\" e \"Remarks\", respectivamente, 'Sugarloaf Mountain Cable Car', '1912', 'Brazil', 'Rio de Janeiro', '396 m' e 'One of the longest cable car rides in the world'.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `Aerial Tramways and Cable Cars` (Name, `Year built`, Country, Town, Height, Remarks) VALUES ('Sugarloaf Mountain Cable Car', '1912', 'Brazil', 'Rio de Janeiro', '396 m', 'One of the longest cable car rides in the world');\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The values 'Sugarloaf Mountain Cable Car', '1912', 'Brazil', 'Rio de Janeiro', '396 m', and 'One of the longest cable car rides in the world' have been inserted into the 'Aerial Tramways and Cable Cars' table.\"]})"
