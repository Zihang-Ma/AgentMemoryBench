I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

I will execute a SQL query to filter the records based on these conditions and select the required column.\nTool: [('QF',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"QF\"]}) The SQL query returned a result of `('QF',)`. This indicates that the round when \"Ivanovic\" won at the \"Paris\" tournament in a year less than 2008 is \"QF\". I will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Tournament history from 2007-2012, and the headers of this table are Tournament,2007,2008,2009,2010,2011,2012.\nQuestion: Add 'Roland Garros' under 'Tournament history from 2007-2012' and fill the columns 'Q2', 'Q1', 'A', '2R', '1R', 'A' with values.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `Tournament history from 2007-2012` (Tournament, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012) VALUES ('Roland Garros', 'Q2', 'Q1', 'A', '2R', '1R', 'A');\"}) The task is to insert a new row into the 'Tournament history from 2007-2012' table with the tournament name 'Roland Garros' and assign specific values to the columns 'Q2', 'Q1', 'A', '2R', '1R', and 'A'. However, the column names provided in the table headers are years (2007, 2008, etc.), not 'Q2', 'Q1', etc. This suggests that the values to be filled might correspond to specific rounds or results for each year, but the exact mapping is unclear. \n\nTo proceed, I will assume that the values provided ('Q2', 'Q1', 'A', '2R', '1R', 'A') are to be assigned to the years 2007 through 2012 in order. If this assumption is incorrect, the mapping would need clarification. For now, I will execute the SQL query to insert the row with the specified values.\nTool: 1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near '2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012) VALUES ('Roland Garros', 'Q2', 'Q1', 'A', '2' at line 1\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `Tournament history from 2007-2012` (Tournament, `2007`, `2008`, `2009`, `2010`, `2011`, `2012`) VALUES ('Roland Garros', 'Q2', 'Q1', 'A', '2R', '1R', 'A');\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The record for 'Roland Garros' has been added to the 'Tournament history from 2007-2012' table with the specified values.\"]});\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The record for 'Roland Garros' has been added to the 'Tournament history from 2007-2012' table with the specified values.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Winners By Country, and the headers of this table are Winner,Country,Most Recent Win.\nQuestion: The `Winners By Country` table is being updated by adding the values '3' for `Winner`, 'Spain' for `Country`, and '2005' for `Most Recent Win`.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `Winners By Country` (Winner, Country, `Most Recent Win`) VALUES ('3', 'Spain', '2005');\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The values '3' for `Winner`, 'Spain' for `Country`, and '2005' for `Most Recent Win` have been added to the `Winners By Country` table.\"]})"
