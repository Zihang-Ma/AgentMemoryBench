I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

However, the column names provided in the table headers are years (2007, 2008, etc.), not 'Q2', 'Q1', etc. This suggests that the values to be filled might correspond to specific rounds or results for each year, but the exact mapping is unclear. \n\nTo proceed, I will assume that the values provided ('Q2', 'Q1', 'A', '2R', '1R', 'A') are to be assigned to the years 2007 through 2012 in order.
