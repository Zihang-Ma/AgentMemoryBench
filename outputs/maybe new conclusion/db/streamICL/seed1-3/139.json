I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

I will execute a SQL query to filter the records based on these conditions and select the required column.\nTool: [('PlayStation Portable',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"PlayStation Portable\"]}) The SQL query returned a result of `('PlayStation Portable',)`. This indicates that the platform for the game developed by \"3g studios\" in a year greater than 2006 is \"PlayStation Portable\". I will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is racers_database, and the headers of this table are Year,Entrant,Chassis,Engine,Points.\nQuestion: What is the average year that the Belanger Motors had an Offenhauser l4 engine?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Year FROM racers_database WHERE Entrant = 'Belanger Motors' AND Engine = 'Offenhauser l4';\"}) To find the average year that \"Belanger Motors\" had an \"Offenhauser L4\" engine, I need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. Filter the records in the `racers_database` table where the `Entrant` is \"Belanger Motors\" and the `Engine` is \"Offenhauser L4\".\n2. Calculate the average of the `Year` column for these filtered records.\n\nI will start by querying the years for which \"Belanger Motors\" had an \"Offenhauser L4\" engine.\nTool: [('1956',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"1956\"]}) The query returned a single year, 1956. Since there is only one record, the average year is the same as that record. \n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Winners By Country, and the headers of this table are Winner,Country,Most Recent Win.\nQuestion: The `Winners By Country` table is being updated by adding the values '3' for `Winner`, 'Spain' for `Country`, and '2005' for `Most Recent Win`.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `Winners By Country` (Winner, Country, `Most Recent Win`) VALUES ('3', 'Spain', '2005');\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The values '3' for `Winner`, 'Spain' for `Country`, and '2005' for `Most Recent Win` have been added to the `Winners By Country` table.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Medal Table, and the headers of this table are Rank,Nation,Gold,Silver,Bronze,Total.\nQuestion: what is the total number of medals between south korea, north korea, sweden, and brazil?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT SUM(Total) FROM `Medal Table` WHERE Nation IN ('South Korea', 'North Korea', 'Sweden', 'Brazil');\"}) To find the total number of medals for South Korea, North Korea, Sweden, and Brazil, I need to sum the `Total` column for these four nations from the `Medal Table`. \n\nI will execute a SQL query to retrieve the sum of the `Total` medals for these nations.\nTool: [(150.0,)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"150\"]})"
