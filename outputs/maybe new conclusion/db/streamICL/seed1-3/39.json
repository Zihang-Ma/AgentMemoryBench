I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

I will execute a SQL query to count the rows where the `School website` matches the given URL.\nTool: [(1,)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"1\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Football Matches, and the headers of this table are Tie no,Home team,Score,Away team,Attendance.\nQuestion: How many attended tie number 19?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Attendance FROM `Football Matches` WHERE Tie no = 19;\"})\nTool: 1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near 'no = 19' at line 1\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Attendance FROM `Football Matches` WHERE `Tie no` = 19;\"})\nTool: [('1,174',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"1,174\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Hospital Information, and the headers of this table are Rank,Hospital,City,County,# Beds,Type of Hospital.\nQuestion: what two hospitals holding consecutive rankings of 8 and 9 respectively, both provide 1200 hospital beds?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Hospital FROM `Hospital Information` WHERE `Rank` IN (8, 9) AND `# Beds` = 1200 ORDER BY `Rank`;\"}) To answer the question, I need to find two hospitals in the `Hospital Information` table that have consecutive rankings of 8 and 9, respectively, and both provide exactly 1200 hospital beds. I will first retrieve the hospitals with rankings 8 and 9 and check if they both have 1200 beds.\nTool: [('Laguna Honda Hospital Rehabilitation Center',), ('Atascadero State Hospital',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Laguna Honda Hospital Rehabilitation Center\", \"Atascadero State Hospital\"]}) The two hospitals with consecutive rankings of 8 and 9, both providing 1200 hospital beds, are \"Laguna Honda Hospital Rehabilitation Center\" and \"Atascadero State Hospital.\"\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is highest_points, and the headers of this table are Rank,Country,Claimant,Highest point,Height.\nQuestion: What is the highest amount of points for rank 95?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Highest point` FROM highest_points WHERE Rank = 95;\"}) To find the highest amount of points for rank 95 in the `highest_points` table, I need to query the `Highest point` column where the `Rank` is 95. I will execute a SQL query to achieve this.\nTool: 1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near '= 95' at line 1\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Highest point` FROM highest_points WHERE `Rank` = 95;\"}) The SQL query had a syntax error because the column name `Rank` contains a reserved keyword in MySQL. To fix this, I will enclose the column name in backticks to ensure it is treated as a regular column name. I will re-execute the query with the corrected syntax.\nTool: [('Đeravica',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Đeravica\"]}) The SQL query returned the result `Đeravica`, which is the highest amount of points for rank 95. I will now commit the final answer."
