I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

I will execute a SQL query to retrieve this information.\nTool: 1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near 'Release) FROM `Music Releases`' at line 1\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT MIN(`Release`) FROM `Music Releases`;\"}) The error indicates that the column name `Release` is reserved or conflicting with a MySQL keyword. To resolve this, I will use backticks around the column name to ensure it is treated as a regular column name. I will execute the corrected SQL query to find the minimum release year.\nTool: [('2004',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"2004\"]}) The SQL query returned a result of `2004`. This indicates that the first title was released in the year 2004. I will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Football_Player_Stats, and the headers of this table are Name,Nation,Position,League Apps,League Goals,FA Cup Apps,FA Cup Goals,Total Apps,Total Goals.\nQuestion: what are the number of league apps ted davis has?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `League Apps` FROM Football_Player_Stats WHERE Name = 'Ted Davis';\"}) To find the number of league apps that Ted Davis has, I need to query the `Football_Player_Stats` table for the row where the `Name` is \"Ted Davis\" and then retrieve the value of the `League Apps` column. I will execute a SQL query to achieve this.\nTool: [('27',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"27\"]}) The SQL query returned a single result: `27`. This is the number of league apps Ted Davis has. I will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Acting Credits, and the headers of this table are Year,Title,Role,Notes.\nQuestion: Insert into acting credits for the film 'The Social Network' with the year 2010 for a student role that was uncredited.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `Acting Credits` (Year, Title, Role, Notes) VALUES (2010, 'The Social Network', 'Student', 'Uncredited');\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The acting credit for 'The Social Network' in 2010 with a student role that was uncredited has been inserted into the 'Acting Credits' table.\"]})"
