I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

This can be achieved using the `COUNT(DISTINCT ...)` function in SQL.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [(1,)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"1\"]}) The SQL query returned the result `1`, indicating there is only one distinct count of \"Raiders first downs\" for game number 9. I will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is football_standings, and the headers of this table are Position,Club,Games played,Wins,Draws,Loses,Goals scored,Goals conceded,Points.\nQuestion: What is the fewest number of games played?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT MIN(`Games played`) AS FewestGames FROM football_standings;\"}) To find the fewest number of games played, I need to query the `football_standings` table and retrieve the minimum value of the `Games played` column. I will execute a SQL query to achieve this.\nTool: [('34',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"34\"]}) The SQL query returned the result `34`, which is the fewest number of games played. I will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is hockey_players, and the headers of this table are Pick #,Player,Nationality,Position,Team from,League from.\nQuestion: What is the total pick # for the D position from a team from Chilliwack Bruins?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT SUM(`Pick #`) FROM hockey_players WHERE Position = 'D' AND `Team from` = 'Chilliwack Bruins';\"}) To find the total pick # for the D position from a team from Chilliwack Bruins, I need to query the `hockey_players` table for all rows where the `Position` is \"D\" and the `Team from` is \"Chilliwack Bruins\", and then sum the values in the `Pick #` column. I will execute a SQL query to achieve this.\nTool: [(167.0,)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"167.0\"]}) The SQL query returned the result `167.0`, which is the total pick number for players in the D position from the Chilliwack Bruins team. I will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is NBA Playoff History, and the headers of this table are Seasons since win,Team,Last series win in NBA Playoffs,Losing streak,Series losses - teams.\nQuestion: Update the 'Last series win in NBA Playoffs' to '2020 NBA Finals', set 'Losing streak' to '0', and clear 'Series losses - teams' fields for the 'Toronto Raptors' in the 'NBA Playoff History' table.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `NBA Playoff History` SET `Last series win in NBA Playoffs` = '2020 NBA Finals', `Losing streak` = 0, `Series losses - teams` = '' WHERE Team = 'Toronto Raptors';\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The 'Last series win in NBA Playoffs' for the 'Toronto Raptors' has been updated to '2020 NBA Finals', their 'Losing streak' has been set to '0', and their 'Series losses - teams' field has been cleared.\"]})"
