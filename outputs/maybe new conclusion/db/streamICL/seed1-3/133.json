I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

      "content": "Here are some examples of the task you have completed:\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is racers_database, and the headers of this table are Year,Entrant,Chassis,Engine,Points.\nQuestion: What is the average year that the Belanger Motors had an Offenhauser l4 engine?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Year FROM racers_database WHERE Entrant = 'Belanger Motors' AND Engine = 'Offenhauser l4';\"}) To find the average year that \"Belanger Motors\" had an \"Offenhauser L4\" engine, I need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. Filter the records in the `racers_database` table where the `Entrant` is \"Belanger Motors\" and the `Engine` is \"Offenhauser L4\".\n2. Calculate the average of the `Year` column for these filtered records.\n\nI will start by querying the years for which \"Belanger Motors\" had an \"Offenhauser L4\" engine.\nTool: [('1956',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"1956\"]}) The query returned a single year, 1956. Since there is only one record, the average year is the same as that record. \n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Racing Stats, and the headers of this table are Year,Starts,Wins,Top 5,Top 10,Poles,Avg. Start,Avg. Finish,Winnings,Position,Team(s).\nQuestion: Name the avg finish for position of 70th\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Avg. Finish` FROM Racing_Stats WHERE Position = 70;\"})\nTool: 1146 (42S02): Table 'dbbench_5f357b69_3ae3_4047_891d_a76014087886.Racing_Stats' doesn't exist\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Avg. Finish` FROM `Racing Stats` WHERE Position = 70;\"})\nTool: [('36.0',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"36.0\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is airlines, and the headers of this table are Airline,ICAO,IATA,Callsign,Commenced operations,Fleet size,Headquarters.\nQuestion: When did the oldest airline start operations?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT MIN(`Commenced operations`) FROM `airlines`;\"}) To determine when the oldest airline started operations, I need to find the minimum value in the `Commenced operations` column of the `airlines` table. I will execute a SQL query to retrieve this information.\nTool: [('1941',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"1941\"]}) The SQL query returned a result of `1941`. This indicates that the oldest airline started operations in the year 1941. I will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Game Records, and the headers of this table are Game,November,Opponent,Score,Record,Points.\nQuestion: Change the opponent value to 'New York Rangers' for the game with number '30' in the 'Game Records' table.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Game Records` SET Opponent = 'New York Rangers' WHERE Game = 30;\"}) To change the opponent value to 'New York Rangers' for the game with number '30' in the 'Game Records' table, I will execute an SQL `UPDATE` query to set the `Opponent` field to 'New York Rangers' where the `Game` field matches '30'.\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The opponent for game 30 has been updated to 'New York Rangers' in the Game Records table.\"]})"
