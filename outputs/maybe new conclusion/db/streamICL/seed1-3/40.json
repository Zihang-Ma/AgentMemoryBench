I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

Then, I can compute the average using SQL.\n\nI will start by querying the gold medals for these three nations.\nTool: [('13',), ('7',), ('1',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"7\"]}) The SQL query returned the number of gold medals for China, Japan, and North Korea as 13, 7, and 1 respectively.
