I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

Then, I can compute the average using SQL.\n\nI will start by querying the gold medals for these three nations.\nTool: [('13',), ('7',), ('1',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"7\"]}) The SQL query returned the number of gold medals for China, Japan, and North Korea as 13, 7, and 1 respectively. To find the average, I will now calculate the mean of these three values.\n\nThe average number of gold medals is (13 + 7 + 1) / 3 = 21 / 3 = 7.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Medal Winners, and the headers of this table are Medal,Name,Sport,Event,Date.\nQuestion: Record the Gold medalist of Men's 50 km Classic event in Cross-country skiing on March 15 as Dmitry Ivanov in the Medal Winners table.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `Medal Winners` (Medal, Name, Sport, Event, Date) VALUES ('Gold', 'Dmitry Ivanov', 'Cross-country skiing', 'Men's 50 km Classic', 'March 15');\"})\nTool: 1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near 's 50 km Classic', 'March 15')' at line 1\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `Medal Winners` (Medal, Name, Sport, Event, Date) VALUES ('Gold', 'Dmitry Ivanov', 'Cross-country skiing', 'Men''s 50 km Classic', 'March 15');\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The Gold medalist of Men's 50 km Classic event in Cross-country skiing on March 15 has been recorded as Dmitry Ivanov in the Medal Winners table.\"]})\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The Gold medalist of Men's 50 km Classic event in Cross-country skiing on March 15 has been recorded as Dmitry Ivanov in the Medal Winners table.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is athlete_performance, and the headers of this table are Year,Competition,Venue,Position,Event,Notes.\nQuestion: Update the athlete's performance data in the 'athlete_performance' table for the '3000 m' event where the athlete finished in '2nd' position.
