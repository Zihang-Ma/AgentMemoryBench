I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

I will execute a SQL query to achieve this.\nTool: [('1976',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"1976\"]}) The SQL query returned the result `1976`, which is the earliest year any of the players were born. I will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Jiu-Jitsu Championships Results, and the headers of this table are Result,Opponent,Method,Event,Notes.\nQuestion: What are the Notes when the Method is decision?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Notes FROM `Jiu-Jitsu Championships Results` WHERE Method = 'decision';\"})\nTool: [('Women +60kg Bronze',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Women +60kg Bronze\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Scottish Challenge Cup Finalists, and the headers of this table are Club,Wins,Last final won,Runners-up,Last final lost,Total final appearances.\nQuestion: How manywins for dunfermline athletic that has a total final appearances less than 2?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Wins` FROM `Scottish Challenge Cup Finalists` WHERE `Club` = 'Dunfermline Athletic' AND `Total final appearances` < 2;\"}) To find the number of wins for Dunfermline Athletic where their total final appearances are less than 2, I need to query the `Scottish Challenge Cup Finalists` table for the row where the `Club` is \"Dunfermline Athletic\" and the `Total final appearances` is less than 2. Then, I will retrieve the value of the `Wins` column for that row. I will execute a SQL query to achieve this.\nTool: [('0',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"0\"]}) The SQL query returned the result `0`, which is the number of wins for Dunfermline Athletic with a total final appearance less than 2. I will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is highest_points, and the headers of this table are Rank,Country,Claimant,Highest point,Height.\nQuestion: What is the highest amount of points for rank 95?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Highest point` FROM highest_points WHERE Rank = 95;\"}) To find the highest amount of points for rank 95 in the `highest_points` table, I need to query the `Highest point` column where the `Rank` is 95. I will execute a SQL query to achieve this.\nTool: 1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near '= 95' at line 1\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Highest point` FROM highest_points WHERE `Rank` = 95;\"}) The SQL query had a syntax error because the column name `Rank` contains a reserved keyword in MySQL. To fix this, I will enclose the column name in backticks to ensure it is treated as a regular column name. I will re-execute the query with the corrected syntax.\nTool: [('Đeravica',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Đeravica\"]}) The SQL query returned the result `Đeravica`, which is the highest amount of points for rank 95. I will now commit the final answer."
