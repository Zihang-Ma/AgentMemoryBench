I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

      "content": "Here are some examples of the task you have completed:\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is highest_points, and the headers of this table are Rank,Country,Claimant,Highest point,Height.\nQuestion: What is the highest amount of points for rank 95?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Highest point` FROM highest_points WHERE Rank = 95;\"}) To find the highest amount of points for rank 95 in the `highest_points` table, I need to query the `Highest point` column where the `Rank` is 95. I will execute a SQL query to achieve this.\nTool: 1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near '= 95' at line 1\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Highest point` FROM highest_points WHERE `Rank` = 95;\"}) The SQL query had a syntax error because the column name `Rank` contains a reserved keyword in MySQL. To fix this, I will enclose the column name in backticks to ensure it is treated as a regular column name. I will re-execute the query with the corrected syntax.\nTool: [('Đeravica',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Đeravica\"]}) The SQL query returned the result `Đeravica`, which is the highest amount of points for rank 95. I will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is SWAT Games, and the headers of this table are Title,Year,Platform,Developer,Publisher.\nQuestion: Name the plaform for year more than 2006 and developer of 3g studios\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Platform FROM `SWAT Games` WHERE Year > 2006 AND Developer = '3g studios';\"}) To answer the question, I need to retrieve the `Platform` for games where the `Year` is greater than 2006 and the `Developer` is \"3g studios\". I will execute a SQL query to filter the records based on these conditions and select the required column.\nTool: [('PlayStation Portable',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"PlayStation Portable\"]}) The SQL query returned a result of `('PlayStation Portable',)`. This indicates that the platform for the game developed by \"3g studios\" in a year greater than 2006 is \"PlayStation Portable\". I will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is sports_venues, and the headers of this table are Venue,Sports,Capacity.\nQuestion: The sports_venues table will have a new record with Venue as 'Boxing Gym', Sports as 'Boxing', and Capacity as '1,500'.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO sports_venues (Venue, Sports, Capacity) VALUES ('Boxing Gym', 'Boxing', '1,500');\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The new record with Venue as 'Boxing Gym', Sports as 'Boxing', and Capacity as '1,500' has been added to the sports_venues table.\"]]})\nTool: Error: Failed to parse tool call. Tool call format is incorrect.\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The new record with Venue as 'Boxing Gym', Sports as 'Boxing', and Capacity as '1,500' has been successfully added to the sports_venues table.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is MMA Fight Record, and the headers of this table are Res.,Record,Opponent,Method,Event,Round.\nQuestion: What event did he fight masato shiozawa?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Event FROM `MMA Fight Record` WHERE Opponent = 'Masato Shiozawa';\"}) To find the event where he fought Masato Shiozawa, I need to query the `Event` column from the `MMA Fight Record` table where the `Opponent` is 'Masato Shiozawa'. I will execute a SQL query to achieve this.\nTool: [('Shooto 2003 - 5/4 in Korakuen Hall',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Shooto 2003 - 5/4 in Korakuen Hall\"]})"
