I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

To answer this, I will first query the `football_matches` table to find all matches where the `Away team score` is 15.11 (101), and then determine the minimum `Crowd` value from those matches.\n\nI will start by retrieving the relevant matches.\nTool: [('16,000',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"16,000\"]}) The SQL query returned a single result: `16,000`. This is the smallest crowd number for a team with an away team score of 15.11 (101), as there is only one match with that score.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Football Matches, and the headers of this table are Tie no,Home team,Score,Away team,Attendance.\nQuestion: How many attended tie number 19?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Attendance FROM `Football Matches` WHERE Tie no = 19;\"})\nTool: 1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near 'no = 19' at line 1\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Attendance FROM `Football Matches` WHERE `Tie no` = 19;\"})\nTool: [('1,174',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"1,174\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is football_standings, and the headers of this table are Position,Club,Games played,Wins,Draws,Loses,Goals scored,Goals conceded,Points.\nQuestion: What is the fewest number of games played?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT MIN(`Games played`) AS FewestGames FROM football_standings;\"}) To find the fewest number of games played, I need to query the `football_standings` table and retrieve the minimum value of the `Games played` column. I will execute a SQL query to achieve this.\nTool: [('34',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"34\"]}) The SQL query returned the result `34`, which is the fewest number of games played. I will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Football_Player_Stats, and the headers of this table are Name,Nation,Position,League Apps,League Goals,FA Cup Apps,FA Cup Goals,Total Apps,Total Goals.\nQuestion: what are the number of league apps ted davis has?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `League Apps` FROM Football_Player_Stats WHERE Name = 'Ted Davis';\"}) To find the number of league apps that Ted Davis has, I need to query the `Football_Player_Stats` table for the row where the `Name` is \"Ted Davis\" and then retrieve the value of the `League Apps` column. I will execute a SQL query to achieve this.\nTool: [('27',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"27\"]}) The SQL query returned a single result: `27`.
