I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

I will execute a SQL query to achieve this.\nTool: [('34',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"34\"]}) The SQL query returned the result `34`, which is the fewest number of games played. I will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Player Goals in International Tournaments, and the headers of this table are Player,Friendlies,FIFA Confederations Cup,FIFA World Cup Qual.,Total Goals.\nQuestion: add up the total number of goals scored by chipperfield and viduka.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Total Goals` FROM `Player Goals in International Tournaments` WHERE Player = 'Chipperfield';\"}) To calculate the total number of goals scored by Chipperfield and Viduka, I need to query the `Player Goals in International Tournaments` table for the `Total Goals` of each player and then sum them up. I will first retrieve the `Total Goals` for Chipperfield and Viduka individually. \n\nI will start by retrieving the `Total Goals` for Chipperfield.\nTool: [('2',)]\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Total Goals` FROM `Player Goals in International Tournaments` WHERE Player = 'Viduka';\"}) The SQL query returned a result of `2` for Chipperfield's total goals. Now, I will retrieve the `Total Goals` for Viduka.\nTool: [('3',)]\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT (SELECT `Total Goals` FROM `Player Goals in International Tournaments` WHERE Player = 'Chipperfield') + (SELECT `Total Goals` FROM `Player Goals in International Tournaments` WHERE Player = 'Viduka') AS Total;\"}) The SQL query returned a result of `3` for Viduka's total goals. Now, I will add up the total number of goals scored by Chipperfield and Viduka.\nTool: [(5.0,)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"5\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is standings, and the headers of this table are Position,Name,Played,Drawn,Lost,Points.\nQuestion: Update the points of ESC Kempten II (N) in the standings table to 6.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE standings SET Points = 6 WHERE Name = 'ESC Kempten II (N)';\"}) To update the points of \"ESC Kempten II (N)\" in the standings table to 6, I need to execute an SQL `UPDATE` statement that targets the specific row where the `Name` column matches \"ESC Kempten II (N)\" and sets the `Points` column to 6. \n\nI will now execute the SQL query to perform this update.\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The points of ESC Kempten II (N) in the standings table have been updated to 6.\"]}) The SQL query executed successfully, and the points for \"ESC Kempten II (N)\" in the standings table have been updated to 6. I will now commit the final answer."
