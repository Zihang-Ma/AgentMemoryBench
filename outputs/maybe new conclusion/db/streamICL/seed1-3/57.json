I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

To find this, I will query the `game score` table to retrieve the `Game` number for the row where the `Score` is \"108-85\" and then determine the minimum value of `Game` from that result. \n\nI will start by retrieving the game number(s) where the score is \"108-85\".\nTool: [('80',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"80\"]}) The SQL query returned the result `80`, which is the game number where the score was \"108-85\". Since the question asks for the lowest game number with that score, and there is only one such game, the answer is `80`.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is game_results, and the headers of this table are Game,Date,Team,Score,High points,High rebounds,High assists,Location Attendance,Record.\nQuestion: What was the score against Portland in game numbers under 20?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Score FROM game_results WHERE Game < 20 AND Team = 'Portland';\"}) To find the score against Portland in game numbers under 20, I need to query the `game_results` table for all rows where the `Game` number is less than 20 and the `Team` is \"Portland\". Then, I will retrieve the `Score` value for those games. I will execute a SQL query to achieve this.\nTool: [('L 97–98 (OT)',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"L 97–98 (OT)\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is raiders_game_stats, and the headers of this table are Game,Date,Opponent,Result,Raiders points,Opponents,Raiders first downs,Record,Attendance.\nQuestion: How many different counts of the Raiders first downs are there for the game number 9?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `Raiders first downs`) AS DistinctFirstDowns FROM raiders_game_stats WHERE Game = 9;\"}) To determine how many different counts of \"Raiders first downs\" exist for game number 9, I will query the `raiders_game_stats` table to find all unique values of the \"Raiders first downs\" column where the \"Game\" is 9. This can be achieved using the `COUNT(DISTINCT ...)` function in SQL.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [(1,)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"1\"]}) The SQL query returned the result `1`, indicating there is only one distinct count of \"Raiders first downs\" for game number 9. I will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Game Records, and the headers of this table are Game,February,Opponent,Score,Record.\nQuestion: Change the February record of Game 62 to 30 in the record database.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Game Records` SET `February` = 30 WHERE Game = 62;\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The February record for Game 62 has been updated to 30 in the Game Records table.\"]})"
