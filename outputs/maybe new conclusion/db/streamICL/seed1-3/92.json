I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

Start,Avg. Finish,Winnings,Position,Team(s).\nQuestion: Name the avg finish for position of 70th\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Avg. Finish` FROM Racing_Stats WHERE Position = 70;\"})\nTool: 1146 (42S02): Table 'dbbench_5f357b69_3ae3_4047_891d_a76014087886.Racing_Stats' doesn't exist\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Avg. Finish` FROM `Racing Stats` WHERE Position = 70;\"})\nTool: [('36.0',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"36.0\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is racers_database, and the headers of this table are Year,Entrant,Chassis,Engine,Points.\nQuestion: What is the average year that the Belanger Motors had an Offenhauser l4 engine?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Year FROM racers_database WHERE Entrant = 'Belanger Motors' AND Engine = 'Offenhauser l4';\"}) To find the average year that \"Belanger Motors\" had an \"Offenhauser L4\" engine, I need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. Filter the records in the `racers_database` table where the `Entrant` is \"Belanger Motors\" and the `Engine` is \"Offenhauser L4\".\n2. Calculate the average of the `Year` column for these filtered records.\n\nI will start by querying the years for which \"Belanger Motors\" had an \"Offenhauser L4\" engine.\nTool: [('1956',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"1956\"]}) The query returned a single year, 1956. Since there is only one record, the average year is the same as that record. \n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Jiu-Jitsu Championships Results, and the headers of this table are Result,Opponent,Method,Event,Notes.\nQuestion: What are the Notes when the Method is decision?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Notes FROM `Jiu-Jitsu Championships Results` WHERE Method = 'decision';\"})\nTool: [('Women +60kg Bronze',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Women +60kg Bronze\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Race_Results, and the headers of this table are Rider,Bike,Laps,Time,Grid.\nQuestion: Set the bike as Yamaha YZF-R1 in the race results table where the rider is Chaz Davies.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE Race_Results SET Bike = 'Yamaha YZF-R1' WHERE Rider = 'Chaz Davies';\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The 'Bike' column for Chaz Davies in the 'Race_Results' table has been set to 'Yamaha YZF-R1' as specified.\"]})"
