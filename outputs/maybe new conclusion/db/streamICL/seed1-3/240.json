I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

I will execute a SQL query to achieve this.\nTool: 1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near '= 95' at line 1\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Highest point` FROM highest_points WHERE `Rank` = 95;\"}) The SQL query had a syntax error because the column name `Rank` contains a reserved keyword in MySQL. To fix this, I will enclose the column name in backticks to ensure it is treated as a regular column name. I will re-execute the query with the corrected syntax.\nTool: [('Đeravica',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Đeravica\"]}) The SQL query returned the result `Đeravica`, which is the highest amount of points for rank 95.
