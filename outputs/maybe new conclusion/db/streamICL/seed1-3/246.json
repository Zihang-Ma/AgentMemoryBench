I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

The association with the highest `Joining year` is the one that entered last. I will execute a SQL query to retrieve this information.\nTool: [('Northern Mariana Islands',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Northern Mariana Islands\"]}) The association that entered last is 'Northern Mariana Islands'. I will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Tournament history from 2007-2012, and the headers of this table are Tournament,2007,2008,2009,2010,2011,2012.\nQuestion: Add 'Roland Garros' under 'Tournament history from 2007-2012' and fill the columns 'Q2', 'Q1', 'A', '2R', '1R', 'A' with values.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `Tournament history from 2007-2012` (Tournament, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012) VALUES ('Roland Garros', 'Q2', 'Q1', 'A', '2R', '1R', 'A');\"}) The task is to insert a new row into the 'Tournament history from 2007-2012' table with the tournament name 'Roland Garros' and assign specific values to the columns 'Q2', 'Q1', 'A', '2R', '1R', and 'A'. However, the column names provided in the table headers are years (2007, 2008, etc.), not 'Q2', 'Q1', etc. This suggests that the values to be filled might correspond to specific rounds or results for each year, but the exact mapping is unclear. \n\nTo proceed, I will assume that the values provided ('Q2', 'Q1', 'A', '2R', '1R', 'A') are to be assigned to the years 2007 through 2012 in order. If this assumption is incorrect, the mapping would need clarification. For now, I will execute the SQL query to insert the row with the specified values.\nTool: 1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near '2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012) VALUES ('Roland Garros', 'Q2', 'Q1', 'A', '2' at line 1\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `Tournament history from 2007-2012` (Tournament, `2007`, `2008`, `2009`, `2010`, `2011`, `2012`) VALUES ('Roland Garros', 'Q2', 'Q1', 'A', '2R', '1R', 'A');\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The record for 'Roland Garros' has been added to the 'Tournament history from 2007-2012' table with the specified values.\"]});\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The record for 'Roland Garros' has been added to the 'Tournament history from 2007-2012' table with the specified values.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is football_standings, and the headers of this table are Position,Club,Games played,Wins,Draws,Loses,Goals scored,Goals conceded,Points.\nQuestion: What is the fewest number of games played?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT MIN(`Games played`) AS FewestGames FROM football_standings;\"}) To find the fewest number of games played, I need to query the `football_standings` table and retrieve the minimum value of the `Games played` column. I will execute a SQL query to achieve this.\nTool: [('34',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"34\"]}) The SQL query returned the result `34`, which is the fewest number of games played. I will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Football Matches, and the headers of this table are Tie no,Home team,Score,Away team,Attendance.\nQuestion: How many attended tie number 19?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Attendance FROM `Football Matches` WHERE Tie no = 19;\"})\nTool: 1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near 'no = 19' at line 1\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Attendance FROM `Football Matches` WHERE `Tie no` = 19;\"})\nTool: [('1,174',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"1,174\"]})"
