I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

To find this, we need to identify the game with the lowest value in the `Game` column that has the specified score. This can be achieved by querying the `Game` column and filtering for the score \"108-85,\" then selecting the minimum value of the `Game` column.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('80',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"80\"]}) The lowest game associated with the score \"108-85\" is game number 80.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is game_results, and the headers of this table are Game,Date,Team,Score,High points,High rebounds,High assists,Location Attendance,Record.\nQuestion: What was the score against Portland in game numbers under 20?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Score FROM game_results WHERE Team = 'Portland' AND Game < 20;\"}) The question is asking for the score of games against Portland where the game number is less than 20. To answer this, we need to query the `Score` column from the `game_results` table where the `Team` is \"Portland\" and the `Game` number is less than 20.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('L 97–98 (OT)',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"L 97–98 (OT)\"]}) The query result shows that the score against Portland in game numbers under 20 was \"L 97–98 (OT)\".\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is raiders_game_stats, and the headers of this table are Game,Date,Opponent,Result,Raiders points,Opponents,Raiders first downs,Record,Attendance.\nQuestion: How many different counts of the Raiders first downs are there for the game number 9?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `Raiders first downs`) FROM `raiders_game_stats` WHERE Game = 9;\"}) The question is asking for the number of different counts of \"Raiders first downs\" for the game number 9 in the `raiders_game_stats` table. To answer this, we need to query the `Raiders first downs` column for the specific game number and count the distinct values.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [(1,)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"1\"]}) The query result shows that there is 1 distinct count of \"Raiders first downs\" for game number 9.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Game Records, and the headers of this table are Game,February,Opponent,Score,Record.\nQuestion: Change the February record of Game 62 to 30 in the record database.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Game Records` SET February = '30' WHERE Game = '62';\"}) The question requires updating the `February` field for the game with number `62` in the `Game Records` table to the value `30`. This can be achieved using an `UPDATE` SQL query with a condition on the `Game` column.\n\nI will now execute the SQL query to update the `February` record for Game 62.\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The `February` record for Game 62 has been successfully updated to `30` in the `Game Records` table.\"]}) The `February` record for Game 62 has been successfully updated to `30` in the `Game Records` table.\n\nI will now commit the final answer."
