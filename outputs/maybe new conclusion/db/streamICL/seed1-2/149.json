I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

      "content": "Here are some examples of the task you have completed:\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is game_results, and the headers of this table are Date,Opponent,Score,Loss,Attendance,Record.\nQuestion: On June 2, the team played against the Red Sox, with a final score of 3-2. The team suffered a loss, with Cotton having a record of 3-3. The game had an attendance of 30,000, bringing the team's overall record to 30-27. The game results were inserted into the database using the following values: Date='June 2', Opponent='Red Sox', Score='3 - 2', Loss='Cotton (3-3)', Attendance='30,000', and Record='30-27'.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO game_results (Date, Opponent, Score, Loss, Attendance, Record) VALUES ('June 2', 'Red Sox', '3 - 2', 'Cotton (3-3)', '30,000', '30-27');\"}) The question provides an `INSERT INTO` query for adding a record about a game result. The data includes the date, opponent, score, loss, attendance, and record. This query is already correctly formatted to insert the specified data into the `game_results` table.\n\nI will now execute the SQL query to insert the data into the table.\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The data about the game result has been successfully inserted into the `game_results` table.\"]}) The data about the game result has been successfully inserted into the `game_results` table.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Football Teams, and the headers of this table are Association,Joining year,Men's team,Women's team,League.\nQuestion: which association entered last?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Association FROM `Football Teams` ORDER BY `Joining year` DESC LIMIT 1;\"}) To determine which association entered last, we need to find the association with the most recent \"Joining year\" from the \"Football Teams\" table. This involves querying the \"Association\" column and ordering the results by \"Joining year\" in descending order, then selecting the top result.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('Northern Mariana Islands',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Northern Mariana Islands\"]}) The association that entered last is the Northern Mariana Islands. \n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is game_results, and the headers of this table are Game,Date,Team,Score,High points,High rebounds,High assists,Location Attendance,Record.\nQuestion: What was the score against Portland in game numbers under 20?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Score FROM game_results WHERE Team = 'Portland' AND Game < 20;\"}) The question is asking for the score of games against Portland where the game number is less than 20. To answer this, we need to query the `Score` column from the `game_results` table where the `Team` is \"Portland\" and the `Game` number is less than 20.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('L 97–98 (OT)',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"L 97–98 (OT)\"]}) The query result shows that the score against Portland in game numbers under 20 was \"L 97–98 (OT)\".\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Hockey_Game_Results, and the headers of this table are Date,Winning Team,Score,Losing Team,Score,OT,City,State/Province,Arena,Attendance.\nQuestion: did dallas or ottawa win the december 9, 1993 game?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Winning Team` FROM Hockey_Game_Results WHERE Date = 'December 9, 1993';\"}) To determine whether Dallas or Ottawa won the game on December 9, 1993, we need to query the `Hockey_Game_Results` table for the game on that date and check which team is listed as the `Winning Team`. \n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('Dallas',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Dallas\"]}) The winning team of the game on December 9, 1993, was Dallas.\n\nI will now commit the final answer."
