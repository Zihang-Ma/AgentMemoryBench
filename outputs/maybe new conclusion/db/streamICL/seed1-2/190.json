I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

A lower position value indicates a better (earlier) finish. \n\nI will first retrieve the positions of both drivers from the table.\nTool: [('5', 'Tony Maggs'), ('11', 'Jo Siffert')]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Tony Maggs\"]}) The query results show that Tony Maggs came in 5th position and Jo Siffert came in 11th position. Since a lower position value indicates an earlier finish, Tony Maggs came in earlier than Jo Siffert.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is US Music Charts, and the headers of this table are Year,US Billboard,US Cash Box,US AC,CAN AC,Title.\nQuestion: What is the US cash box before 1978 with a US billboard of 35?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `US Cash Box` FROM `US Music Charts` WHERE Year < 1978 AND `US Billboard` = 35;\"})\nTool: [('18',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"18\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Miss World Winners, and the headers of this table are Year,Winner,Represented,Placement at Miss World.\nQuestion: In the `Miss World Winners` table, update the `Represented` column to 'Taiwan' where the value in the `Year` column is equal to '2015'.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Miss World Winners` SET Represented = 'Taiwan' WHERE Year = '2015';\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The `Represented` column in the `Miss World Winners` table has been updated to 'Taiwan' where the `Year` column is equal to '2015'.\"]]})\nTool: Error: Failed to parse tool call.
