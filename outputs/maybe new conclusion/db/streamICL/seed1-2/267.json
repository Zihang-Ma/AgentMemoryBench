I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

To answer this, we need to query the `Player` and `Pick` columns from the `NBA Draft History` table where the `School/Club Team` column contains \"California\" and then find the player with the smallest `Pick` value (i.e., the first pick).\n\nI will first retrieve the relevant data to identify the first player picked from a school in California.\nTool: [('Michael Miley', '39')]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Michael Miley\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Game Records, and the headers of this table are Game,November,Opponent,Score,Record,Points.\nQuestion: Change the opponent value to 'New York Rangers' for the game with number '30' in the 'Game Records' table.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Game Records` SET Opponent = 'New York Rangers' WHERE Game = '30';\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The opponent value for game number 30 has been successfully updated to 'New York Rangers' in the 'Game Records' table.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Hockey_Game_Results, and the headers of this table are Date,Winning Team,Score,Losing Team,Score,OT,City,State/Province,Arena,Attendance.\nQuestion: did dallas or ottawa win the december 9, 1993 game?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Winning Team` FROM Hockey_Game_Results WHERE Date = 'December 9, 1993';\"}) To determine whether Dallas or Ottawa won the game on December 9, 1993, we need to query the `Hockey_Game_Results` table for the game on that date and check which team is listed as the `Winning Team`. \n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('Dallas',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Dallas\"]}) The winning team of the game on December 9, 1993, was Dallas.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Squash Players Ranking, and the headers of this table are Rank,Player Name,No. of Titles,Runner-up,Final Appearances.\nQuestion: which player has the highest number of titles?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Player Name`, `No. of Titles` FROM `Squash Players Ranking` ORDER BY `No. of Titles` DESC LIMIT 1;\"}) To find the player with the highest number of titles, we need to query the `Player Name` and `No. of Titles` columns from the `Squash Players Ranking` table and sort the results by `No. of Titles` in descending order. The top result will give us the player with the highest number of titles.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('Jansher Khan', '8')]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Jansher Khan\"]}) The player with the highest number of titles is Jansher Khan, with 8 titles.\n\nI will now commit the final answer."
