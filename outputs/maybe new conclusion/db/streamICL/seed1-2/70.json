I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

      "content": "Here are some examples of the task you have completed:\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Football Teams, and the headers of this table are Association,Joining year,Men's team,Women's team,League.\nQuestion: which association entered last?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Association FROM `Football Teams` ORDER BY `Joining year` DESC LIMIT 1;\"}) To determine which association entered last, we need to find the association with the most recent \"Joining year\" from the \"Football Teams\" table. This involves querying the \"Association\" column and ordering the results by \"Joining year\" in descending order, then selecting the top result.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('Northern Mariana Islands',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Northern Mariana Islands\"]}) The association that entered last is the Northern Mariana Islands. \n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Olympic Medal Table, and the headers of this table are Rank,Nation,Gold,Silver,Bronze,Total.\nQuestion: The Olympic Medal Table for Australia was updated to have 2 silver, 5 bronze, and a total of 10 medals.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Olympic Medal Table` SET Silver = 2, Bronze = 5, Total = 10 WHERE Nation = 'Australia';\"}) The question requires updating the `Olympic Medal Table` for Australia with specific values: 2 silver medals, 5 bronze medals, and a total of 10 medals. This implies that the `Gold` count for Australia should be calculated as `Total - Silver - Bronze = 10 - 2 - 5 = 3`. \n\nTo perform this update, we need to execute an `UPDATE` SQL query that sets the `Silver`, `Bronze`, and `Total` columns for the row where `Nation` is \"Australia\". \n\nI will now execute the SQL query to update the table.\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The Olympic Medal Table for Australia has been updated to have 2 silver, 5 bronze, and a total of 10 medals.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Soccer Team Performance Table, and the headers of this table are Year,Division,League,Regular Season,Playoffs,Open Cup.\nQuestion: other than npsl, what league has ny mens soccer team played in?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT League FROM `Soccer Team Performance Table` WHERE Name = 'NY Men''s Soccer Team';\"}) The question asks for the league that the NY men's soccer team has played in, excluding \"NPSL.\" To answer this, we need to query the \"League\" column from the \"Soccer Team Performance Table\" where the \"Name\" of the team is \"NY Men's Soccer Team\" and filter out any rows where the \"League\" is \"NPSL.\"\n\nI will first check if there is a specific \"Name\" for the NY men's soccer team in the table. If not, I will need to adjust the query accordingly. \n\nLet me start by retrieving the \"League\" values for the NY men's soccer team. \n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: 1054 (42S22): Unknown column 'Name' in 'where clause'\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT * FROM `Soccer Team Performance Table` LIMIT 10;\"}) The error indicates that the column \"Name\" does not exist in the \"Soccer Team Performance Table.\" This means I need to adjust the query to use the correct column name that represents the team's name. Since the column \"Name\" is not present, I will assume that the team's name might be represented in another column, such as \"Regular Season\" or \"Playoffs,\" or that the table might not have a specific column for team names.\n\nI will now attempt to find the league by checking the data in the table and identifying the correct column that might contain the team's name. Let me first retrieve all the data from the table to understand its structure better.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('2008', '4', 'NPSL', '2nd, Mid Atlantic', 'Did not qualify', 'Did not qualify'), ('2009', '4', 'NPSL', '5th, Atlantic', 'Did not qualify', 'Did not enter'), ('2010', '4', 'NPSL', '5th, Atlantic', 'Did not qualify', 'Did not enter'), ('2010–11', '5', 'CSL I', 'In progress', 'N/A', 'N/A'), ('2011', '4', 'NPSL', '4th, Atlantic', 'Did not qualify', 'Did not enter'), ('2012', '4', 'NPSL', '3rd, Atlantic', 'Did not qualify', 'Did not enter'), ('2013', '4', 'NPSL', '3rd, Atlantic', 'Did not qualify',...\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"CSL I\"]}) From the data retrieved, it appears that the \"Name\" of the team is not explicitly listed in the table. However, the data shows that the team has played in the \"NPSL\" league in several years. The question asks for the league other than \"NPSL\" that the NY men's soccer team has played in.\n\nLooking at the data, in the year \"2010–11,\" the team played in \"CSL I\" (Continental Soccer League I). This is the only instance where the team played in a league other than \"NPSL.\"\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is standings, and the headers of this table are Position,Name,Played,Drawn,Lost,Points.\nQuestion: Update the points of ESC Kempten II (N) in the standings table to 6.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE standings SET Points = 6 WHERE Name = 'ESC Kempten II (N)' LIMIT 1;\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The points of ESC Kempten II (N) have been updated to 6 in the standings table.\"]})"
