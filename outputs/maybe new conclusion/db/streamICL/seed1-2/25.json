I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

      "content": "Here are some examples of the task you have completed:\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is filmography, and the headers of this table are Year,Film,Role,Language,Notes.\nQuestion: Set notes to '-' for old films before 2010 in the filmography table.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE filmography SET Notes = '-' WHERE Year < 2010;\"}) The question requires updating the `Notes` column in the `filmography` table to '-' for all records where the `Year` is less than 2010. This can be achieved using an `UPDATE` SQL query that targets the rows with `Year < 2010`.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The Notes column has been set to '-' for old films before 2010 in the filmography table.\"]}) The SQL query has been executed successfully, setting the `Notes` column to '-' for all old films before 2010 in the `filmography` table.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Music Releases, and the headers of this table are Release,Artist,Title,Notes,Album.\nQuestion: what year was the first title released?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT MIN(Release) FROM `Music Releases`;\"}) The question is asking for the year of the first title release in the `Music Releases` table. To find this, we need to extract the `Release` year from the table. Since the `Release` column likely contains the year of release, we can use the `MIN` function to find the earliest year.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: 1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near 'Release) FROM `Music Releases`' at line 1\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT MIN(`Release`) FROM `Music Releases`;\"}) The error indicates that the column name `Release` is reserved or not properly quoted. To resolve this, I will use backticks around the column name to ensure it is treated as a regular column name.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('2004',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"2004\"]}) The value in the `Release` column for the first title release is \"2004\".\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Football_Player_Stats, and the headers of this table are Name,Nation,Position,League Apps,League Goals,FA Cup Apps,FA Cup Goals,Total Apps,Total Goals.\nQuestion: what are the number of league apps ted davis has?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `League Apps` FROM `Football_Player_Stats` WHERE Name = 'Ted Davis';\"}) To find the number of league apps that Ted Davis has, we need to query the \"League Apps\" column from the \"Football_Player_Stats\" table where the \"Name\" is 'Ted Davis'.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('27',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"27\"]}) The number of league apps Ted Davis has is 27.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Filmography, and the headers of this table are Year,Title,Role,Notes.\nQuestion: Set the Notes column to 'Released' and the Role column to 'Todd' for the rows where the Title column is 'Chaos Walking' in the Filmography table.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE Filmography SET Notes = 'Released', Role = 'Todd' WHERE Title = 'Chaos Walking';\"}) The question requires updating the `Notes` and `Role` columns in the `Filmography` table for the rows where the `Title` is \"Chaos Walking\". This can be achieved by using an `UPDATE` SQL query that targets the specific rows.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The Notes column has been set to 'Released' and the Role column to 'Todd' for the rows where the Title column is 'Chaos Walking' in the Filmography table.\"]}) The SQL query has been executed successfully, updating the `Notes` column to 'Released' and the `Role` column to 'Todd' for the rows where the `Title` is 'Chaos Walking' in the `Filmography` table.\n\nI will now commit the final answer."
