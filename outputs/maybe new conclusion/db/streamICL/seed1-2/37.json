I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

      "content": "Here are some examples of the task you have completed:\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is TV_Show_Seasons, and the headers of this table are Season,Episodes,Season Premiere,Season Finale.\nQuestion: Set the number of episodes as '21' for season '8' in the TV_Show_Seasons table.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `TV_Show_Seasons` SET Episodes = '21' WHERE Season = '8';\"}) The question requires updating the `Episodes` field for season `8` in the `TV_Show_Seasons` table to the value `21`. This can be achieved using an `UPDATE` SQL query with a condition on the `Season` column.\n\nI will now execute the SQL query to update the number of episodes for season 8.\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The number of episodes for season 8 in the TV_Show_Seasons table has been successfully updated to 21.\"]}) The number of episodes for season 8 in the TV_Show_Seasons table has been successfully updated to 21.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Music Releases, and the headers of this table are Release,Artist,Title,Notes,Album.\nQuestion: what year was the first title released?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT MIN(Release) FROM `Music Releases`;\"}) The question is asking for the year of the first title release in the `Music Releases` table. To find this, we need to extract the `Release` year from the table. Since the `Release` column likely contains the year of release, we can use the `MIN` function to find the earliest year.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: 1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near 'Release) FROM `Music Releases`' at line 1\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT MIN(`Release`) FROM `Music Releases`;\"}) The error indicates that the column name `Release` is reserved or not properly quoted. To resolve this, I will use backticks around the column name to ensure it is treated as a regular column name.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('2004',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"2004\"]}) The value in the `Release` column for the first title release is \"2004\".\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is game_results, and the headers of this table are Game,Date,Team,Score,High points,High rebounds,High assists,Location Attendance,Record.\nQuestion: What was the score against Portland in game numbers under 20?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Score FROM game_results WHERE Team = 'Portland' AND Game < 20;\"}) The question is asking for the score of games against Portland where the game number is less than 20. To answer this, we need to query the `Score` column from the `game_results` table where the `Team` is \"Portland\" and the `Game` number is less than 20.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('L 97–98 (OT)',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"L 97–98 (OT)\"]}) The query result shows that the score against Portland in game numbers under 20 was \"L 97–98 (OT)\".\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is US Music Charts, and the headers of this table are Year,US Billboard,US Cash Box,US AC,CAN AC,Title.\nQuestion: What is the US cash box before 1978 with a US billboard of 35?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `US Cash Box` FROM `US Music Charts` WHERE Year < 1978 AND `US Billboard` = 35;\"})\nTool: [('18',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"18\"]})"
