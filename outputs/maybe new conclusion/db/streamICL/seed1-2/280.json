I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

      "content": "Here are some examples of the task you have completed:\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Footballers, and the headers of this table are Season,Footballer,Club,Position,Nationality.\nQuestion: Change Andile Jali's position to DF in the Footballers table.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE Footballers SET Position = 'DF' WHERE Footballer = 'Andile Jali';\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Andile Jali's position has been changed to DF in the Footballers table.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Soccer Team Performance Table, and the headers of this table are Year,Division,League,Regular Season,Playoffs,Open Cup.\nQuestion: other than npsl, what league has ny mens soccer team played in?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT League FROM `Soccer Team Performance Table` WHERE Name = 'NY Men''s Soccer Team';\"}) The question asks for the league that the NY men's soccer team has played in, excluding \"NPSL.\" To answer this, we need to query the \"League\" column from the \"Soccer Team Performance Table\" where the \"Name\" of the team is \"NY Men's Soccer Team\" and filter out any rows where the \"League\" is \"NPSL.\"\n\nI will first check if there is a specific \"Name\" for the NY men's soccer team in the table. If not, I will need to adjust the query accordingly. \n\nLet me start by retrieving the \"League\" values for the NY men's soccer team. \n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: 1054 (42S22): Unknown column 'Name' in 'where clause'\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT * FROM `Soccer Team Performance Table` LIMIT 10;\"}) The error indicates that the column \"Name\" does not exist in the \"Soccer Team Performance Table.\" This means I need to adjust the query to use the correct column name that represents the team's name. Since the column \"Name\" is not present, I will assume that the team's name might be represented in another column, such as \"Regular Season\" or \"Playoffs,\" or that the table might not have a specific column for team names.\n\nI will now attempt to find the league by checking the data in the table and identifying the correct column that might contain the team's name. Let me first retrieve all the data from the table to understand its structure better.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('2008', '4', 'NPSL', '2nd, Mid Atlantic', 'Did not qualify', 'Did not qualify'), ('2009', '4', 'NPSL', '5th, Atlantic', 'Did not qualify', 'Did not enter'), ('2010', '4', 'NPSL', '5th, Atlantic', 'Did not qualify', 'Did not enter'), ('2010–11', '5', 'CSL I', 'In progress', 'N/A', 'N/A'), ('2011', '4', 'NPSL', '4th, Atlantic', 'Did not qualify', 'Did not enter'), ('2012', '4', 'NPSL', '3rd, Atlantic', 'Did not qualify', 'Did not enter'), ('2013', '4', 'NPSL', '3rd, Atlantic', 'Did not qualify',...\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"CSL I\"]}) From the data retrieved, it appears that the \"Name\" of the team is not explicitly listed in the table. However, the data shows that the team has played in the \"NPSL\" league in several years. The question asks for the league other than \"NPSL\" that the NY men's soccer team has played in.\n\nLooking at the data, in the year \"2010–11,\" the team played in \"CSL I\" (Continental Soccer League I). This is the only instance where the team played in a league other than \"NPSL.\"\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is draft_picks, and the headers of this table are Round,Pick #,Overall,Name,Position,College.\nQuestion: Modify the name in draft_picks table from 'John Smith' to 'Johnny Smith'.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE draft_picks SET Name = 'Johnny Smith' WHERE Name = 'John Smith';\"}) The question requires updating the `Name` field in the `draft_picks` table from \"John Smith\" to \"Johnny Smith\". This can be achieved by using an `UPDATE` SQL query that targets the specific row(s) where the `Name` is \"John Smith\".\n\nI will now execute the SQL query to update the name in the table.\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The name in the draft_picks table has been modified from 'John Smith' to 'Johnny Smith'.\"]}) The name in the `draft_picks` table has been successfully updated from \"John Smith\" to \"Johnny Smith\".\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Olympic Flag Bearers, and the headers of this table are #,Event year,Season,Ceremony,Flag bearer,Sport.\nQuestion: Change the sport of the first Olympic Flag Bearer to Basketball in the table 'Olympic Flag Bearers'.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Olympic Flag Bearers` SET Sport = 'Basketball' WHERE `Event year` = (SELECT MIN(`Event year`) FROM `Olympic Flag Bearers`);\"})\nTool: 1093 (HY000): You can't specify target table 'Olympic Flag Bearers' for update in FROM clause\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Olympic Flag Bearers` SET Sport = 'Basketball' WHERE `#` = 1;\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The sport of the first Olympic Flag Bearer has been changed to Basketball.\"]})"
