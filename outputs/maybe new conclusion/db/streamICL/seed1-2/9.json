I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

To answer this, we need to query the `Pick #` column from the `hockey_players` table where the `Position` is \"D\" and the `Team from` is \"Chilliwack Bruins\" and then sum those pick numbers.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [(167.0,)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"167\"]}) The total pick number for players in the \"D\" position from the \"Chilliwack Bruins\" team is 167.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Football Matches, and the headers of this table are Tie no,Home team,Score,Away team,Attendance.\nQuestion: How many attended tie number 19?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Attendance FROM `Football Matches` WHERE `Tie no` = 19;\"}) To find the attendance for tie number 19, we need to query the `Attendance` column from the `Football Matches` table where the `Tie no` is 19.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('1,174',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"1,174\"]}) The attendance for tie number 19 was 1,174.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Game Results, and the headers of this table are Game,Date,Opponent,Score,Location,Record.\nQuestion: What is the earliest game with a score of 99-89?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT MIN(Game) FROM `Game Results` WHERE Score = '99-89';\"}) The question is asking for the earliest game (i.e., the game with the smallest `Game` number) that has a score of \"99-89\" in the `Game Results` table. To find this, we need to query the `Game` column and filter for the score \"99-89,\" then select the minimum value of the `Game` column.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('13',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"13\"]}) The query result shows that the earliest game with a score of \"99-89\" is game number 13.\n\nI will now commit the final answer."
