I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

Then, we can calculate the average of those years.\n\nI will start by querying the years where the entrant is \"Belanger Motors\" and the engine is \"Offenhauser L4\".\nTool: [('1956',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"1956\"]}) The query result shows that Belanger Motors had an Offenhauser L4 engine in the year 1956. Since there is only one year, the average year is also 1956.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is standings, and the headers of this table are Position,Name,Played,Drawn,Lost,Points.\nQuestion: Update the points of ESC Kempten II (N) in the standings table to 6.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE standings SET Points = 6 WHERE Name = 'ESC Kempten II (N)' LIMIT 1;\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The points of ESC Kempten II (N) have been updated to 6 in the standings table.\"]})"
