I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

To answer this, we need to query the `Pick #` column from the `hockey_players` table where the `Position` is \"D\" and the `Team from` is \"Chilliwack Bruins\" and then sum those pick numbers.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [(167.0,)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"167\"]}) The total pick number for players in the \"D\" position from the \"Chilliwack Bruins\" team is 167.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Football_Stats, and the headers of this table are Season,Team,Country,Division,Apps,Goals.\nQuestion: what was the number of apps for spartak nizhy novgorod?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Apps FROM Football_Stats WHERE Team = 'Spartak Nizhny Novgorod';\"}) To find the number of apps for Spartak Nizhny Novgorod, we need to query the \"Apps\" column from the \"Football_Stats\" table where the \"Team\" is 'Spartak Nizhny Novgorod'.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('36',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"36\"]}) The number of apps for Spartak Nizhny Novgorod is 36.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is NBA Draft History, and the headers of this table are Round,Pick,Player,Position,Nationality,School/Club Team.\nQuestion: first player picked who attended school in california\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Player, Pick FROM `NBA Draft History` WHERE `School/Club Team` LIKE '%California%' ORDER BY Pick ASC LIMIT 1;\"}) The question asks for the first player picked in the NBA Draft History table who attended a school in California. To answer this, we need to query the `Player` and `Pick` columns from the `NBA Draft History` table where the `School/Club Team` column contains \"California\" and then find the player with the smallest `Pick` value (i.e., the first pick).\n\nI will first retrieve the relevant data to identify the first player picked from a school in California.\nTool: [('Michael Miley', '39')]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Michael Miley\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is draft_picks, and the headers of this table are Round,Pick #,Overall,Name,Position,College.\nQuestion: Modify the name in draft_picks table from 'John Smith' to 'Johnny Smith'.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE draft_picks SET Name = 'Johnny Smith' WHERE Name = 'John Smith';\"}) The question requires updating the `Name` field in the `draft_picks` table from \"John Smith\" to \"Johnny Smith\". This can be achieved by using an `UPDATE` SQL query that targets the specific row(s) where the `Name` is \"John Smith\".\n\nI will now execute the SQL query to update the name in the table.\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The name in the draft_picks table has been modified from 'John Smith' to 'Johnny Smith'.\"]}) The name in the `draft_picks` table has been successfully updated from \"John Smith\" to \"Johnny Smith\".\n\nI will now commit the final answer."
