I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

To answer this, we need to query the `Player` and `Pick` columns from the `NBA Draft History` table where the `School/Club Team` column contains \"California\" and then find the player with the smallest `Pick` value (i.e., the first pick).\n\nI will first retrieve the relevant data to identify the first player picked from a school in California.\nTool: [('Michael Miley', '39')]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Michael Miley\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Olympic Flag Bearers, and the headers of this table are #,Event year,Season,Ceremony,Flag bearer,Sport.\nQuestion: Change the sport of the first Olympic Flag Bearer to Basketball in the table 'Olympic Flag Bearers'.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Olympic Flag Bearers` SET Sport = 'Basketball' WHERE `Event year` = (SELECT MIN(`Event year`) FROM `Olympic Flag Bearers`);\"})\nTool: 1093 (HY000): You can't specify target table 'Olympic Flag Bearers' for update in FROM clause\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Olympic Flag Bearers` SET Sport = 'Basketball' WHERE `#` = 1;\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The sport of the first Olympic Flag Bearer has been changed to Basketball.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is standings, and the headers of this table are Position,Name,Played,Drawn,Lost,Points.\nQuestion: Update the points of ESC Kempten II (N) in the standings table to 6.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE standings SET Points = 6 WHERE Name = 'ESC Kempten II (N)' LIMIT 1;\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The points of ESC Kempten II (N) have been updated to 6 in the standings table.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is draft_picks, and the headers of this table are Round,Pick #,Overall,Name,Position,College.\nQuestion: Modify the name in draft_picks table from 'John Smith' to 'Johnny Smith'.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE draft_picks SET Name = 'Johnny Smith' WHERE Name = 'John Smith';\"}) The question requires updating the `Name` field in the `draft_picks` table from \"John Smith\" to \"Johnny Smith\". This can be achieved by using an `UPDATE` SQL query that targets the specific row(s) where the `Name` is \"John Smith\".\n\nI will now execute the SQL query to update the name in the table.\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The name in the draft_picks table has been modified from 'John Smith' to 'Johnny Smith'.\"]}) The name in the `draft_picks` table has been successfully updated from \"John Smith\" to \"Johnny Smith\".\n\nI will now commit the final answer."
