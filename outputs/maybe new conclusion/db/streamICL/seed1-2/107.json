I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

The team suffered a loss, with Cotton having a record of 3-3. The game had an attendance of 30,000, bringing the team's overall record to 30-27. The game results were inserted into the database using the following values: Date='June 2', Opponent='Red Sox', Score='3 - 2', Loss='Cotton (3-3)', Attendance='30,000', and Record='30-27'.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO game_results (Date, Opponent, Score, Loss, Attendance, Record) VALUES ('June 2', 'Red Sox', '3 - 2', 'Cotton (3-3)', '30,000', '30-27');\"}) The question provides an `INSERT INTO` query for adding a record about a game result. The data includes the date, opponent, score, loss, attendance, and record. This query is already correctly formatted to insert the specified data into the `game_results` table.\n\nI will now execute the SQL query to insert the data into the table.\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The data about the game result has been successfully inserted into the `game_results` table.\"]}) The data about the game result has been successfully inserted into the `game_results` table.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Game Records, and the headers of this table are Game,February,Opponent,Score,Record.\nQuestion: Change the February record of Game 62 to 30 in the record database.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Game Records` SET February = '30' WHERE Game = '62';\"}) The question requires updating the `February` field for the game with number `62` in the `Game Records` table to the value `30`. This can be achieved using an `UPDATE` SQL query with a condition on the `Game` column.\n\nI will now execute the SQL query to update the `February` record for Game 62.\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The `February` record for Game 62 has been successfully updated to `30` in the `Game Records` table.\"]}) The `February` record for Game 62 has been successfully updated to `30` in the `Game Records` table.\n\nI will now commit the final answer."
