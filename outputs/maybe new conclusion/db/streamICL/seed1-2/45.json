I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

Set the year to '1998', competition to 'Commonwealth Games', venue to 'Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia', position to '1st', and notes to '8:37.92'.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE athlete_performance SET Year = '1998', Competition = 'Commonwealth Games', Venue = 'Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia', Position = '1st', Notes = '8:37.92' WHERE Event = '3000 m' AND Position = '2nd';\"}) The question requires updating the performance data for the '3000 m' event where the athlete finished in '2nd' position. The specific fields to update are `Year`, `Competition`, `Venue`, `Position`, and `Notes`. This can be achieved using an `UPDATE` SQL query with conditions on the specified columns.\n\nI will now execute the SQL query to update the athlete's performance data.\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The athlete's performance data for the '3000 m' event where the athlete finished in '2nd' position has been updated with the new values: Year to '1998', Competition to 'Commonwealth Games', Venue to 'Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia', Position to '1st', and Notes to '8:37.92'.\"]}) The athlete's performance data for the '3000 m' event where the athlete finished in '2nd' position has been updated with the new values: `Year` to '1998', `Competition` to 'Commonwealth Games', `Venue` to 'Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia', `Position` to '1st', and `Notes` to '8:37.92'.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Athletic Achievements, and the headers of this table are Year,Competition,Venue,Position,Event.\nQuestion: In the Athletic Achievements table, the Position column will be updated to '2nd', where the Year column is '2003', the Competition column is 'World Championships', and the Event column is '3000 m st.'\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Athletic Achievements` SET Position = '2nd' WHERE Year = '2003' AND Competition = 'World Championships' AND Event = '3000 m st.';\"}) The question requires updating the `Position` column to '2nd' in the `Athletic Achievements` table where the `Year` is '2003', the `Competition` is 'World Championships', and the `Event` is '3000 m st.'.
