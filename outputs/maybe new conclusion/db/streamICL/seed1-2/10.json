I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

      "content": "Here are some examples of the task you have completed:\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Football Teams, and the headers of this table are Association,Joining year,Men's team,Women's team,League.\nQuestion: which association entered last?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Association FROM `Football Teams` ORDER BY `Joining year` DESC LIMIT 1;\"}) To determine which association entered last, we need to find the association with the most recent \"Joining year\" from the \"Football Teams\" table. This involves querying the \"Association\" column and ordering the results by \"Joining year\" in descending order, then selecting the top result.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('Northern Mariana Islands',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Northern Mariana Islands\"]}) The association that entered last is the Northern Mariana Islands. \n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Football Matches, and the headers of this table are Tie no,Home team,Score,Away team,Attendance.\nQuestion: How many attended tie number 19?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Attendance FROM `Football Matches` WHERE `Tie no` = 19;\"}) To find the attendance for tie number 19, we need to query the `Attendance` column from the `Football Matches` table where the `Tie no` is 19.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('1,174',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"1,174\"]}) The attendance for tie number 19 was 1,174.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Footballers, and the headers of this table are Season,Footballer,Club,Position,Nationality.\nQuestion: Change Andile Jali's position to DF in the Footballers table.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE Footballers SET Position = 'DF' WHERE Footballer = 'Andile Jali';\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Andile Jali's position has been changed to DF in the Footballers table.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Soccer Team Performance Table, and the headers of this table are Year,Division,League,Regular Season,Playoffs,Open Cup.\nQuestion: other than npsl, what league has ny mens soccer team played in?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT League FROM `Soccer Team Performance Table` WHERE Name = 'NY Men''s Soccer Team';\"}) The question asks for the league that the NY men's soccer team has played in, excluding \"NPSL.\" To answer this, we need to query the \"League\" column from the \"Soccer Team Performance Table\" where the \"Name\" of the team is \"NY Men's Soccer Team\" and filter out any rows where the \"League\" is \"NPSL.\"\n\nI will first check if there is a specific \"Name\" for the NY men's soccer team in the table. If not, I will need to adjust the query accordingly. \n\nLet me start by retrieving the \"League\" values for the NY men's soccer team. \n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: 1054 (42S22): Unknown column 'Name' in 'where clause'\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT * FROM `Soccer Team Performance Table` LIMIT 10;\"}) The error indicates that the column \"Name\" does not exist in the \"Soccer Team Performance Table.\" This means I need to adjust the query to use the correct column name that represents the team's name. Since the column \"Name\" is not present, I will assume that the team's name might be represented in another column, such as \"Regular Season\" or \"Playoffs,\" or that the table might not have a specific column for team names.\n\nI will now attempt to find the league by checking the data in the table and identifying the correct column that might contain the team's name. Let me first retrieve all the data from the table to understand its structure better.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('2008', '4', 'NPSL', '2nd, Mid Atlantic', 'Did not qualify', 'Did not qualify'), ('2009', '4', 'NPSL', '5th, Atlantic', 'Did not qualify', 'Did not enter'), ('2010', '4', 'NPSL', '5th, Atlantic', 'Did not qualify', 'Did not enter'), ('2010–11', '5', 'CSL I', 'In progress', 'N/A', 'N/A'), ('2011', '4', 'NPSL', '4th, Atlantic', 'Did not qualify', 'Did not enter'), ('2012', '4', 'NPSL', '3rd, Atlantic', 'Did not qualify', 'Did not enter'), ('2013', '4', 'NPSL', '3rd, Atlantic', 'Did not qualify',...\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"CSL I\"]}) From the data retrieved, it appears that the \"Name\" of the team is not explicitly listed in the table. However, the data shows that the team has played in the \"NPSL\" league in several years. The question asks for the league other than \"NPSL\" that the NY men's soccer team has played in.\n\nLooking at the data, in the year \"2010–11,\" the team played in \"CSL I\" (Continental Soccer League I). This is the only instance where the team played in a league other than \"NPSL.\"\n\nI will now commit the final answer."
