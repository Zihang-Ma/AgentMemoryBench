I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

This implies that the `Gold` count for Australia should be calculated as `Total - Silver - Bronze = 10 - 2 - 5 = 3`. \n\nTo perform this update, we need to execute an `UPDATE` SQL query that sets the `Silver`, `Bronze`, and `Total` columns for the row where `Nation` is \"Australia\". \n\nI will now execute the SQL query to update the table.\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The Olympic Medal Table for Australia has been updated to have 2 silver, 5 bronze, and a total of 10 medals.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Olympic Medal Table, and the headers of this table are Rank,Nation,Gold,Silver,Bronze,Total.\nQuestion: Great Britain's bronze count in the Olympic Medal Table is updated to 5 and their total count is incremented by 1.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Olympic Medal Table` SET Bronze = 5, Total = Total + 1 WHERE Nation = 'Great Britain';\"}) The question requires updating the `Olympic Medal Table` for Great Britain with a new bronze count of 5 and incrementing their total count by 1. This implies that the `Gold` and `Silver` counts for Great Britain should remain unchanged, while the `Bronze` and `Total` columns are updated accordingly.\n\nTo perform this update, we need to execute an `UPDATE` SQL query that sets the `Bronze` column to 5 and increments the `Total` column by 1 for the row where `Nation` is \"Great Britain\". \n\nI will now execute the SQL query to update the table.\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Great Britain's bronze count in the Olympic Medal Table is updated to 5 and their total count is incremented by 1.\"]}) The SQL query has been executed successfully, updating Great Britain's bronze count to 5 and incrementing their total count by 1 in the `Olympic Medal Table`.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Athlete_results, and the headers of this table are Year,Competition,Venue,Position,Event,Notes.\nQuestion: In the table Athlete_results, a row is inserted with the values '2008' for Year, 'Olympic Games' for Competition, 'Beijing, China' for Venue, '1st' for Position, '800 metres' for Event, and '-' for Notes.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO Athlete_results (Year, Competition, Venue, Position, Event, Notes) VALUES ('2008', 'Olympic Games', 'Beijing, China', '1st', '800 metres', '-');\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"A new row has been added to the `Athlete_results` table with the values: Year '2008', Competition 'Olympic Games', Venue 'Beijing, China', Position '1st', Event '800 metres', and Notes '-'.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Athletic Achievements, and the headers of this table are Year,Competition,Venue,Position,Event.\nQuestion: In the Athletic Achievements table, the Position column will be updated to '2nd', where the Year column is '2003', the Competition column is 'World Championships', and the Event column is '3000 m st.'\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Athletic Achievements` SET Position = '2nd' WHERE Year = '2003' AND Competition = 'World Championships' AND Event = '3000 m st.';\"}) The question requires updating the `Position` column to '2nd' in the `Athletic Achievements` table where the `Year` is '2003', the `Competition` is 'World Championships', and the `Event` is '3000 m st.'.
