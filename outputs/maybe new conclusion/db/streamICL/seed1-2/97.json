I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

Then, we can calculate the average of those years.\n\nI will start by querying the years where the entrant is \"Belanger Motors\" and the engine is \"Offenhauser L4\".\nTool: [('1956',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"1956\"]}) The query result shows that Belanger Motors had an Offenhauser L4 engine in the year 1956. Since there is only one year, the average year is also 1956.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Athletic Achievements, and the headers of this table are Year,Competition,Venue,Position,Event.\nQuestion: In the Athletic Achievements table, the Position column will be updated to '2nd', where the Year column is '2003', the Competition column is 'World Championships', and the Event column is '3000 m st.'\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Athletic Achievements` SET Position = '2nd' WHERE Year = '2003' AND Competition = 'World Championships' AND Event = '3000 m st.';\"}) The question requires updating the `Position` column to '2nd' in the `Athletic Achievements` table where the `Year` is '2003', the `Competition` is 'World Championships', and the `Event` is '3000 m st.'. This can be achieved using an `UPDATE` SQL query with conditions on the specified columns.\n\nI will now execute the SQL query to update the table.\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The `Position` column in the `Athletic Achievements` table has been updated to '2nd' where the `Year` is '2003', the `Competition` is 'World Championships', and the `Event` is '3000 m st.'.\"]}) The `Position` column in the `Athletic Achievements` table has been updated to '2nd' where the `Year` is '2003', the `Competition` is 'World Championships', and the `Event` is '3000 m st.'.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Tournament Results, and the headers of this table are Tournament,2005,2006,2007,2008,2009,2010,2011,2012,2013,Win %.\nQuestion: What in 2007 has a 2008 of sf, and a 2010 of f?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `2007` FROM `Tournament Results` WHERE `2008` = 'sf' AND `2010` = 'f';\"}) The question is asking for the value in the `2007` column where the `2008` column is \"sf\" and the `2010` column is \"f\" in the `Tournament Results` table. To answer this, we need to query the `2007` column with the specified conditions on the `2008` and `2010` columns.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('F',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"F\"]}) The value in the `2007` column where the `2008` column is \"sf\" and the `2010` column is \"f\" is \"F\".\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Athlete Results, and the headers of this table are Year,Competition,Venue,Position,Event,Notes.\nQuestion: In the `Athlete Results` table, add a new row with the following values: Year is '2018', Competition is 'Lisbon Half Marathon', Venue is 'Lisbon, Portugal', Position is '1st', Event is 'Half marathon' and Notes is '1:09:12'.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `Athlete Results` (Year, Competition, Venue, Position, Event, Notes) VALUES ('2018', 'Lisbon Half Marathon', 'Lisbon, Portugal', '1st', 'Half marathon', '1:09:12');\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"A new row has been added to the `Athlete Results` table with the values: Year '2018', Competition 'Lisbon Half Marathon', Venue 'Lisbon, Portugal', Position '1st', Event 'Half marathon', and Notes '1:09:12'.\"]})"
