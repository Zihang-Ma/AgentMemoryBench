I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

This can be achieved using an `UPDATE` SQL query with conditions on the specified columns.\n\nI will now execute the SQL query to update the table.\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The `Points` column in the `Formula One Results` table has been updated to 18 where the `Year` column is equal to 2010 and the `Entrant` column is equal to 'Red Bull Racing'.\"]}) The `Points` column in the `Formula One Results` table has been updated to 18 where the `Year` column is equal to 2010 and the `Entrant` column is equal to 'Red Bull Racing'.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is car_racing_schedule, and the headers of this table are Race,Length,Class,Circuit,Date.\nQuestion: Modify the car racing schedule by updating the race of Grand Prix of Atlanta to be classified as Formula 1 and take place at the Atlanta Motor Speedway.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE car_racing_schedule SET Class = 'Formula 1', Circuit = 'Atlanta Motor Speedway' WHERE Race = 'Grand Prix of Atlanta';\"}) The question requires updating the `Class` and `Circuit` columns in the `car_racing_schedule` table for the `Race` \"Grand Prix of Atlanta\". This can be achieved using an `UPDATE` SQL query with a condition on the `Race` column.\n\nI will now execute the SQL query to update the table.\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The race of Grand Prix of Atlanta in the car racing schedule has been updated to be classified as Formula 1 and take place at the Atlanta Motor Speedway.\"]}) The `Class` and `Circuit` columns in the `car_racing_schedule` table have been updated for the `Race` \"Grand Prix of Atlanta\" to \"Formula 1\" and \"Atlanta Motor Speedway\", respectively.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is racers_database, and the headers of this table are Year,Entrant,Chassis,Engine,Points.\nQuestion: What is the average year that the Belanger Motors had an Offenhauser l4 engine?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Year FROM racers_database WHERE Entrant = 'Belanger Motors' AND Engine = 'Offenhauser l4';\"}) To find the average year that Belanger Motors had an Offenhauser L4 engine, we need to first retrieve all the years where the entrant is \"Belanger Motors\" and the engine is \"Offenhauser L4\" from the `racers_database` table. Then, we can calculate the average of those years.\n\nI will start by querying the years where the entrant is \"Belanger Motors\" and the engine is \"Offenhauser L4\".\nTool: [('1956',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"1956\"]}) The query result shows that Belanger Motors had an Offenhauser L4 engine in the year 1956. Since there is only one year, the average year is also 1956.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Horse_Racing_Champions, and the headers of this table are Year,Winner,Second,Third,Starters.\nQuestion: The 2021 Horse Racing Champions database includes the following information: Year='2021', Winner='Medina Spirit', Second='Mandaloun', Third='Hot Rod Charlie', and Starters='19'.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO Horse_Racing_Champions (Year, Winner, Second, Third, Starters) VALUES ('2021', 'Medina Spirit', 'Mandaloun', 'Hot Rod Charlie', '19');\"}) The question provides information about the `Horse_Racing_Champions` table, which contains the columns `Year`, `Winner`, `Second`, `Third`, and `Starters`. It also specifies the values for the 2021 entry: `Year='2021'`, `Winner='Medina Spirit'`, `Second='Mandaloun'`, `Third='Hot Rod Charlie'`, and `Starters='19'`. This information is likely meant to be inserted into the table.\n\nTo insert this data, I will use an `INSERT INTO` SQL query to add a new row with the specified values.\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"A new row has been added to the `Horse_Racing_Champions` table with the values: Year '2021', Winner 'Medina Spirit', Second 'Mandaloun', Third 'Hot Rod Charlie', and Starters '19'.\"]})"
