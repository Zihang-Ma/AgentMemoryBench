I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

This involves querying the \"Association\" column and ordering the results by \"Joining year\" in descending order, then selecting the top result.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('Northern Mariana Islands',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Northern Mariana Islands\"]}) The association that entered last is the Northern Mariana Islands. \n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Tournament Results, and the headers of this table are Tournament,2005,2006,2007,2008,2009,2010,2011,2012,2013,Win %.\nQuestion: What in 2007 has a 2008 of sf, and a 2010 of f?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `2007` FROM `Tournament Results` WHERE `2008` = 'sf' AND `2010` = 'f';\"}) The question is asking for the value in the `2007` column where the `2008` column is \"sf\" and the `2010` column is \"f\" in the `Tournament Results` table. To answer this, we need to query the `2007` column with the specified conditions on the `2008` and `2010` columns.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('F',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"F\"]}) The value in the `2007` column where the `2008` column is \"sf\" and the `2010` column is \"f\" is \"F\".\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Scottish Challenge Cup Finalists, and the headers of this table are Club,Wins,Last final won,Runners-up,Last final lost,Total final appearances.\nQuestion: How manywins for dunfermline athletic that has a total final appearances less than 2?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Total final appearances` FROM `Scottish Challenge Cup Finalists` WHERE Club = 'Dunfermline Athletic';\"}) The question asks for the number of wins for Dunfermline Athletic, but only if their total final appearances are less than 2. This means we need to first check the \"Total final appearances\" for Dunfermline Athletic in the \"Scottish Challenge Cup Finalists\" table. If it is less than 2, we then retrieve their \"Wins\" value.\n\nI will first query the \"Total final appearances\" for Dunfermline Athletic to determine if it is less than 2.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('1',)]\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Wins` FROM `Scottish Challenge Cup Finalists` WHERE Club = 'Dunfermline Athletic';\"}) The query result shows that Dunfermline Athletic has a total of 1 final appearance. Since this is less than 2, we now need to retrieve their number of wins.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query to get the number of wins for Dunfermline Athletic:\nTool: [('0',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"0\"]}) The query result shows that Dunfermline Athletic has 0 wins. Since their total final appearances are 1, which is less than 2, the answer to the question is 0.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Squash Players Ranking, and the headers of this table are Rank,Player Name,No. of Titles,Runner-up,Final Appearances.\nQuestion: which player has the highest number of titles?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Player Name`, `No. of Titles` FROM `Squash Players Ranking` ORDER BY `No. of Titles` DESC LIMIT 1;\"}) To find the player with the highest number of titles, we need to query the `Player Name` and `No. of Titles` columns from the `Squash Players Ranking` table and sort the results by `No. of Titles` in descending order. The top result will give us the player with the highest number of titles.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('Jansher Khan', '8')]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Jansher Khan\"]}) The player with the highest number of titles is Jansher Khan, with 8 titles.\n\nI will now commit the final answer."
