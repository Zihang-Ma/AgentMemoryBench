I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

Then, we can calculate the average of those years.\n\nI will start by querying the years where the entrant is \"Belanger Motors\" and the engine is \"Offenhauser L4\".\nTool: [('1956',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"1956\"]}) The query result shows that Belanger Motors had an Offenhauser L4 engine in the year 1956. Since there is only one year, the average year is also 1956.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Jiu-Jitsu Championships Results, and the headers of this table are Result,Opponent,Method,Event,Notes.\nQuestion: What are the Notes when the Method is decision?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Notes FROM `Jiu-Jitsu Championships Results` WHERE Method = 'decision';\"})\nTool: [('Women +60kg Bronze',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Women +60kg Bronze\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Race_Results, and the headers of this table are Rider,Bike,Laps,Time,Grid.\nQuestion: Set the bike as Yamaha YZF-R1 in the race results table where the rider is Chaz Davies.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE Race_Results SET Bike = 'Yamaha YZF-R1' WHERE Rider = 'Chaz Davies';\"}) The question requires updating the `Bike` column to \"Yamaha YZF-R1\" in the `Race_Results` table where the `Rider` is Chaz Davies. This can be achieved using an `UPDATE` SQL query with a condition on the `Rider` column.\n\nI will now execute the SQL query to update the table.\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The bike as Yamaha YZF-R1 in the race results table where the rider is Chaz Davies has been set.\"]}) The `Bike` column in the `Race_Results` table has been set to \"Yamaha YZF-R1\" where the `Rider` column is equal to \"Chaz Davies\".\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Grand Prix Result, and the headers of this table are Pos,Driver,Entrant,Constructor,Time/Retired,Grid.\nQuestion: who came in earlier, tony maggs or jo siffert?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Pos, Driver FROM `Grand Prix Result` WHERE Driver IN ('Tony Maggs', 'Jo Siffert');\"}) To determine who came in earlier between Tony Maggs and Jo Siffert, we need to compare their positions (`Pos`) in the `Grand Prix Result` table. A lower position value indicates a better (earlier) finish. \n\nI will first retrieve the positions of both drivers from the table.\nTool: [('5', 'Tony Maggs'), ('11', 'Jo Siffert')]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Tony Maggs\"]}) The query results show that Tony Maggs came in 5th position and Jo Siffert came in 11th position. Since a lower position value indicates an earlier finish, Tony Maggs came in earlier than Jo Siffert.\n\nI will now commit the final answer."
