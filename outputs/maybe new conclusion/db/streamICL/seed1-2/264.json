I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

To answer this, we need to query the `Score` column from the `game_results` table where the `Team` is \"Portland\" and the `Game` number is less than 20.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('L 97–98 (OT)',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"L 97–98 (OT)\"]}) The query result shows that the score against Portland in game numbers under 20 was \"L 97–98 (OT)\".\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is athlete_performance, and the headers of this table are Year,Competition,Venue,Position,Event,Notes.\nQuestion: Update the athlete's performance data in the 'athlete_performance' table for the '3000 m' event where the athlete finished in '2nd' position.

The specific fields to update are `Year`, `Competition`, `Venue`, `Position`, and `Notes`. This can be achieved using an `UPDATE` SQL query with conditions on the specified columns.\n\nI will now execute the SQL query to update the athlete's performance data.\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The athlete's performance data for the '3000 m' event where the athlete finished in '2nd' position has been updated with the new values: Year to '1998', Competition to 'Commonwealth Games', Venue to 'Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia', Position to '1st', and Notes to '8:37.92'.\"]}) The athlete's performance data for the '3000 m' event where the athlete finished in '2nd' position has been updated with the new values: `Year` to '1998', `Competition` to 'Commonwealth Games', `Venue` to 'Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia', `Position` to '1st', and `Notes` to '8:37.92'.\n\nI will now commit the final answer."
