I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

To answer this, we need to query the `Score` column from the `game_results` table where the `Team` is \"Portland\" and the `Game` number is less than 20.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('L 97–98 (OT)',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"L 97–98 (OT)\"]}) The query result shows that the score against Portland in game numbers under 20 was \"L 97–98 (OT)\".\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Game Records, and the headers of this table are Game,February,Opponent,Score,Record.\nQuestion: Change the February record of Game 62 to 30 in the record database.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Game Records` SET February = '30' WHERE Game = '62';\"}) The question requires updating the `February` field for the game with number `62` in the `Game Records` table to the value `30`. This can be achieved using an `UPDATE` SQL query with a condition on the `Game` column.\n\nI will now execute the SQL query to update the `February` record for Game 62.\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The `February` record for Game 62 has been successfully updated to `30` in the `Game Records` table.\"]}) The `February` record for Game 62 has been successfully updated to `30` in the `Game Records` table.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Tournament Results by Year, and the headers of this table are Tournament,2006,2007,2008,2009,2011,2012.\nQuestion: Update the tournament results for the Australian Open in 2006 to 'QF', 2007 to 'SF', 2008 to 'F', 2009 to 'A', 2011 to 'A', and 2012 to 'A' in the 'Tournament Results by Year' table.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Tournament Results by Year` SET `2006` = 'QF', `2007` = 'SF', `2008` = 'F', `2009` = 'A', `2011` = 'A', `2012` = 'A' WHERE Tournament = 'Australian Open';\"}) The question requires updating the results for the \"Australian Open\" tournament in the `Tournament Results by Year` table. Specifically, the values for the years 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2011, and 2012 need to be set to \"QF\", \"SF\", \"F\", \"A\", \"A\", and \"A\", respectively. This can be achieved using an `UPDATE` SQL query with conditions on the `Tournament` column.\n\nI will now execute the SQL query to update the tournament results.\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The tournament results for the Australian Open have been updated in the 'Tournament Results by Year' table with the following values: 2006 to 'QF', 2007 to 'SF', 2008 to 'F', 2009 to 'A', 2011 to 'A', and 2012 to 'A'.\"]}) The tournament results for the \"Australian Open\" in the `Tournament Results by Year` table have been updated to the specified values for the years 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2011, and 2012.\n\nI will now commit the final answer."
