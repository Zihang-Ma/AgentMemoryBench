I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

This implies that the `Gold` count for Australia should be calculated as `Total - Silver - Bronze = 10 - 2 - 5 = 3`. \n\nTo perform this update, we need to execute an `UPDATE` SQL query that sets the `Silver`, `Bronze`, and `Total` columns for the row where `Nation` is \"Australia\". \n\nI will now execute the SQL query to update the table.\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The Olympic Medal Table for Australia has been updated to have 2 silver, 5 bronze, and a total of 10 medals.\"]})"
