I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

The top result will give us the player with the highest number of titles.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('Jansher Khan', '8')]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Jansher Khan\"]}) The player with the highest number of titles is Jansher Khan, with 8 titles.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is tennis_results, and the headers of this table are Year,Tournament,Surface,Round,Winner,Score.\nQuestion: What is Round, when Winner is \"Ivanovic\", when Year is less than 2008, and when Tournament is \"Paris\"?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Round FROM tennis_results WHERE Winner = 'Ivanovic' AND Year < 2008 AND Tournament = 'Paris';\"})\nTool: [('QF',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"QF\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Tournament Results, and the headers of this table are Tournament,2005,2006,2007,2008,2009,2010,2011,2012,2013,Win %.\nQuestion: What in 2007 has a 2008 of sf, and a 2010 of f?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `2007` FROM `Tournament Results` WHERE `2008` = 'sf' AND `2010` = 'f';\"}) The question is asking for the value in the `2007` column where the `2008` column is \"sf\" and the `2010` column is \"f\" in the `Tournament Results` table. To answer this, we need to query the `2007` column with the specified conditions on the `2008` and `2010` columns.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('F',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"F\"]}) The value in the `2007` column where the `2008` column is \"sf\" and the `2010` column is \"f\" is \"F\".\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is racers_database, and the headers of this table are Year,Entrant,Chassis,Engine,Points.\nQuestion: What is the average year that the Belanger Motors had an Offenhauser l4 engine?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Year FROM racers_database WHERE Entrant = 'Belanger Motors' AND Engine = 'Offenhauser l4';\"}) To find the average year that Belanger Motors had an Offenhauser L4 engine, we need to first retrieve all the years where the entrant is \"Belanger Motors\" and the engine is \"Offenhauser L4\" from the `racers_database` table. Then, we can calculate the average of those years.\n\nI will start by querying the years where the entrant is \"Belanger Motors\" and the engine is \"Offenhauser L4\".\nTool: [('1956',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"1956\"]}) The query result shows that Belanger Motors had an Offenhauser L4 engine in the year 1956. Since there is only one year, the average year is also 1956.\n\nI will now commit the final answer."
