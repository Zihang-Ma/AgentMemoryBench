I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

      "content": "Here are some examples of the task you have completed:\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is NBA Draft History, and the headers of this table are Round,Pick,Player,Position,Nationality,School/Club Team.\nQuestion: first player picked who attended school in california\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Player, Pick FROM `NBA Draft History` WHERE `School/Club Team` LIKE '%California%' ORDER BY Pick ASC LIMIT 1;\"}) The question asks for the first player picked in the NBA Draft History table who attended a school in California. To answer this, we need to query the `Player` and `Pick` columns from the `NBA Draft History` table where the `School/Club Team` column contains \"California\" and then find the player with the smallest `Pick` value (i.e., the first pick).\n\nI will first retrieve the relevant data to identify the first player picked from a school in California.\nTool: [('Michael Miley', '39')]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Michael Miley\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Music Releases, and the headers of this table are Release,Artist,Title,Notes,Album.\nQuestion: what year was the first title released?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT MIN(Release) FROM `Music Releases`;\"}) The question is asking for the year of the first title release in the `Music Releases` table. To find this, we need to extract the `Release` year from the table. Since the `Release` column likely contains the year of release, we can use the `MIN` function to find the earliest year.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: 1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near 'Release) FROM `Music Releases`' at line 1\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT MIN(`Release`) FROM `Music Releases`;\"}) The error indicates that the column name `Release` is reserved or not properly quoted. To resolve this, I will use backticks around the column name to ensure it is treated as a regular column name.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('2004',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"2004\"]}) The value in the `Release` column for the first title release is \"2004\".\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Scottish Challenge Cup Finalists, and the headers of this table are Club,Wins,Last final won,Runners-up,Last final lost,Total final appearances.\nQuestion: How manywins for dunfermline athletic that has a total final appearances less than 2?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Total final appearances` FROM `Scottish Challenge Cup Finalists` WHERE Club = 'Dunfermline Athletic';\"}) The question asks for the number of wins for Dunfermline Athletic, but only if their total final appearances are less than 2. This means we need to first check the \"Total final appearances\" for Dunfermline Athletic in the \"Scottish Challenge Cup Finalists\" table. If it is less than 2, we then retrieve their \"Wins\" value.\n\nI will first query the \"Total final appearances\" for Dunfermline Athletic to determine if it is less than 2.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('1',)]\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Wins` FROM `Scottish Challenge Cup Finalists` WHERE Club = 'Dunfermline Athletic';\"}) The query result shows that Dunfermline Athletic has a total of 1 final appearance. Since this is less than 2, we now need to retrieve their number of wins.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query to get the number of wins for Dunfermline Athletic:\nTool: [('0',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"0\"]}) The query result shows that Dunfermline Athletic has 0 wins. Since their total final appearances are 1, which is less than 2, the answer to the question is 0.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is game_results, and the headers of this table are Game,Date,Team,Score,High points,High rebounds,High assists,Location Attendance,Record.\nQuestion: What was the score against Portland in game numbers under 20?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Score FROM game_results WHERE Team = 'Portland' AND Game < 20;\"}) The question is asking for the score of games against Portland where the game number is less than 20. To answer this, we need to query the `Score` column from the `game_results` table where the `Team` is \"Portland\" and the `Game` number is less than 20.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('L 97–98 (OT)',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"L 97–98 (OT)\"]}) The query result shows that the score against Portland in game numbers under 20 was \"L 97–98 (OT)\".\n\nI will now commit the final answer."
