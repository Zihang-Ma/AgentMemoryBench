I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

      "content": "Here are some examples of the task you have completed:\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Football Teams, and the headers of this table are Association,Joining year,Men's team,Women's team,League.\nQuestion: which association entered last?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Association FROM `Football Teams` ORDER BY `Joining year` DESC LIMIT 1;\"}) To determine which association entered last, we need to find the association with the most recent \"Joining year\" from the \"Football Teams\" table. This involves querying the \"Association\" column and ordering the results by \"Joining year\" in descending order, then selecting the top result.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('Northern Mariana Islands',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Northern Mariana Islands\"]}) The association that entered last is the Northern Mariana Islands. \n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Island Area by Country/Region, and the headers of this table are Rank,Island,Area\\\\n(km²),Area\\\\n(sq mi),Country/Countries/Region.\nQuestion: which island has the most area, tiree or kasos?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Island`, `Area\\\\\\\\n(km²)` FROM `Island Area by Country/Region` WHERE `Island` IN ('Tiree', 'Kasos');\"}) To determine which island, Tiree or Kasos, has the most area, we need to compare their respective \"Area (km²)\" values from the `Island Area by Country/Region` table. \n\nWe will execute a SQL query to fetch the area of both islands and compare them.\nTool: [('Tiree', '78'), ('Kasos', '66')]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Tiree\"]}) The query result shows that Tiree has an area of 78 km² and Kasos has an area of 66 km². Therefore, Tiree has the most area.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is 1952_British_Grand_Prix_0, and the headers of this table are Pos,No,Driver,Constructor,Time,Gap.\nQuestion: The 1952 British Grand Prix saw Tony Gaze finish 22nd in his HWM - Alta with a time of 2:02, trailing the winner by 12 seconds. The INSERT INTO query for this data would be: INSERT INTO 1952_British_Grand_Prix_0 (Pos, No, Driver, Constructor, Time, Gap) VALUES (22, 2, 'Tony Gaze', 'HWM - Alta', '2:02', '+12');\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO 1952_British_Grand_Prix_0 (Pos, No, Driver, Constructor, Time, Gap) VALUES (22, 2, 'Tony Gaze', 'HWM - Alta', '2:02', '+12');\"}) The question provides an `INSERT INTO` query for adding a record about Tony Gaze's performance in the 1952 British Grand Prix. This query is already correctly formatted to insert the specified data into the `1952_British_Grand_Prix_0` table.\n\nI will now execute the SQL query to insert the data into the table.\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The data about Tony Gaze's performance in the 1952 British Grand Prix has been successfully inserted into the `1952_British_Grand_Prix_0` table.\"]}) The data about Tony Gaze's performance in the 1952 British Grand Prix has been successfully inserted into the `1952_British_Grand_Prix_0` table.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is performance, and the headers of this table are Rank,Name,Nationality,Time.\nQuestion: Set the nationality of Ian Thorpe in the performance table to 'United Kingdom'.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE performance SET Nationality = 'United Kingdom' WHERE Name = 'Ian Thorpe';\"}) The question requires updating the `Nationality` field in the `performance` table for the row where the `Name` is \"Ian Thorpe\". This can be achieved by using an `UPDATE` SQL query that targets the specific row.\n\nI will now execute the SQL query to update Ian Thorpe's nationality in the table.\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The nationality of Ian Thorpe has been set to 'United Kingdom' in the performance table.\"]}) The nationality of Ian Thorpe has been set to 'United Kingdom' in the performance table.\n\nI will now commit the final answer."
