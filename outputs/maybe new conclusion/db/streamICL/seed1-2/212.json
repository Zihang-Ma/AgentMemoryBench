I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

This can be achieved by using an `UPDATE` SQL query that targets the specific row.\n\nI will now execute the SQL query to update the notes for the movie \"Black Panther\" in the table.\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The Notes field in the Movies table has been set to 'First Marvel movie with a predominantly black cast' where the Title field equals 'Black Panther'.\"]}) The Notes field for the movie \"Black Panther\" in the Movies table has been successfully set to 'First Marvel movie with a predominantly black cast'.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Actress Filmography, and the headers of this table are Year,Title,Role,Notes.\nQuestion: Change the year and notes of the film 'Jumping the Broom' in the table 'Actress Filmography' to 2010 and 'romantic comedy' respectively.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Actress Filmography` SET Year = 2010, Notes = 'romantic comedy' WHERE Title = 'Jumping the Broom';\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The year and notes of the film 'Jumping the Broom' in the 'Actress Filmography' table have been changed to 2010 and 'romantic comedy' respectively.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Music Releases, and the headers of this table are Release,Artist,Title,Notes,Album.\nQuestion: what year was the first title released?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT MIN(Release) FROM `Music Releases`;\"}) The question is asking for the year of the first title release in the `Music Releases` table. To find this, we need to extract the `Release` year from the table. Since the `Release` column likely contains the year of release, we can use the `MIN` function to find the earliest year.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: 1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near 'Release) FROM `Music Releases`' at line 1\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT MIN(`Release`) FROM `Music Releases`;\"}) The error indicates that the column name `Release` is reserved or not properly quoted. To resolve this, I will use backticks around the column name to ensure it is treated as a regular column name.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('2004',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"2004\"]}) The value in the `Release` column for the first title release is \"2004\".\n\nI will now commit the final answer."
