I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

      "content": "Here are some examples of the task you have completed:\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Football Matches, and the headers of this table are Tie no,Home team,Score,Away team,Date,Attendance.\nQuestion: Set the score of tie number 1 in the Football Matches table to '2 - 2'.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Football Matches` SET Score = '2 - 2' WHERE `Tie no` = 1;\"}) To update the score of tie number 1 in the Football Matches table to '2 - 2', we will use an `UPDATE` SQL query with a condition on the `Tie no` column.\n\nI will now execute the SQL query to update the score for tie number 1.\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The score of tie number 1 in the Football Matches table has been successfully updated to '2 - 2'.\"]}) The score of tie number 1 in the Football Matches table has been successfully updated to '2 - 2'.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Football Teams, and the headers of this table are Association,Joining year,Men's team,Women's team,League.\nQuestion: which association entered last?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Association FROM `Football Teams` ORDER BY `Joining year` DESC LIMIT 1;\"}) To determine which association entered last, we need to find the association with the most recent \"Joining year\" from the \"Football Teams\" table. This involves querying the \"Association\" column and ordering the results by \"Joining year\" in descending order, then selecting the top result.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('Northern Mariana Islands',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Northern Mariana Islands\"]}) The association that entered last is the Northern Mariana Islands. \n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Scottish Challenge Cup Finalists, and the headers of this table are Club,Wins,Last final won,Runners-up,Last final lost,Total final appearances.\nQuestion: How manywins for dunfermline athletic that has a total final appearances less than 2?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Total final appearances` FROM `Scottish Challenge Cup Finalists` WHERE Club = 'Dunfermline Athletic';\"}) The question asks for the number of wins for Dunfermline Athletic, but only if their total final appearances are less than 2. This means we need to first check the \"Total final appearances\" for Dunfermline Athletic in the \"Scottish Challenge Cup Finalists\" table. If it is less than 2, we then retrieve their \"Wins\" value.\n\nI will first query the \"Total final appearances\" for Dunfermline Athletic to determine if it is less than 2.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('1',)]\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Wins` FROM `Scottish Challenge Cup Finalists` WHERE Club = 'Dunfermline Athletic';\"}) The query result shows that Dunfermline Athletic has a total of 1 final appearance. Since this is less than 2, we now need to retrieve their number of wins.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query to get the number of wins for Dunfermline Athletic:\nTool: [('0',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"0\"]}) The query result shows that Dunfermline Athletic has 0 wins. Since their total final appearances are 1, which is less than 2, the answer to the question is 0.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is game_results, and the headers of this table are Game,Date,Team,Score,High points,High rebounds,High assists,Location Attendance,Record.\nQuestion: What was the score against Portland in game numbers under 20?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Score FROM game_results WHERE Team = 'Portland' AND Game < 20;\"}) The question is asking for the score of games against Portland where the game number is less than 20. To answer this, we need to query the `Score` column from the `game_results` table where the `Team` is \"Portland\" and the `Game` number is less than 20.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('L 97–98 (OT)',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"L 97–98 (OT)\"]}) The query result shows that the score against Portland in game numbers under 20 was \"L 97–98 (OT)\".\n\nI will now commit the final answer."
