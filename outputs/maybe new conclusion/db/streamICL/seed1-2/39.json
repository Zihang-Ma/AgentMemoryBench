I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

      "content": "Here are some examples of the task you have completed:\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Schools Information, and the headers of this table are School,Gender,Age Range,Religious Affiliation,Location,School website.\nQuestion: How many schools have a website of http://www.camp.herts.sch.uk/?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `Schools Information` WHERE `School website` = 'http://www.camp.herts.sch.uk/';\"}) To determine how many schools have a website of \"http://www.camp.herts.sch.uk/\", we need to query the `Schools Information` table and count the number of rows where the `School website` column matches this exact URL.\n\nI will now execute the SQL query to count the number of schools with the specified website.\nTool: [(1,)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"1\"]}) The query result shows that there is 1 school with a website of \"http://www.camp.herts.sch.uk/\".\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is game_results, and the headers of this table are Game,Date,Team,Score,High points,High rebounds,High assists,Location Attendance,Record.\nQuestion: What was the score against Portland in game numbers under 20?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Score FROM game_results WHERE Team = 'Portland' AND Game < 20;\"}) The question is asking for the score of games against Portland where the game number is less than 20. To answer this, we need to query the `Score` column from the `game_results` table where the `Team` is \"Portland\" and the `Game` number is less than 20.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('L 97–98 (OT)',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"L 97–98 (OT)\"]}) The query result shows that the score against Portland in game numbers under 20 was \"L 97–98 (OT)\".\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Football Matches, and the headers of this table are Tie no,Home team,Score,Away team,Attendance.\nQuestion: How many attended tie number 19?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Attendance FROM `Football Matches` WHERE `Tie no` = 19;\"}) To find the attendance for tie number 19, we need to query the `Attendance` column from the `Football Matches` table where the `Tie no` is 19.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('1,174',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"1,174\"]}) The attendance for tie number 19 was 1,174.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is highest_points, and the headers of this table are Rank,Country,Claimant,Highest point,Height.\nQuestion: What is the highest amount of points for rank 95?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Highest point` FROM `highest_points` WHERE Rank = 95 LIMIT 1;\"}) To find the highest amount of points for rank 95, we need to query the `Highest point` column from the `highest_points` table where the `Rank` is 95.\n\nI will now execute the SQL query to retrieve the highest amount of points for rank 95.\nTool: 1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near '= 95 LIMIT 1' at line 1\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"DESCRIBE `highest_points`;\"}) The error suggests there might be an issue with the `Rank` column's data type. It is possible that the `Rank` column is defined as a string (VARCHAR) instead of a numeric type. Let's check the data type of the `Rank` column in the `highest_points` table.\n\nI will now execute the SQL query to check the data type of the `Rank` column.\nTool: [('Rank', 'text', 'YES', '', None, ''), ('Country', 'text', 'YES', '', None, ''), ('Claimant', 'text', 'YES', '', None, ''), ('Highest point', 'text', 'YES', '', None, ''), ('Height', 'text', 'YES', '', None, '')]\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Highest point` FROM `highest_points` WHERE `Rank` = '95' LIMIT 1;\"}) The `Rank` column is of type `text`, which means it should be treated as a string. Therefore, I need to adjust the SQL query to use quotes around the value `95` when comparing it to the `Rank` column.\n\nI will now execute the corrected SQL query to retrieve the highest amount of points for rank 95.\nTool: [('Đeravica',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Đeravica\"]}) The highest amount of points for rank 95 is Đeravica.\n\nI will now commit the final answer."
