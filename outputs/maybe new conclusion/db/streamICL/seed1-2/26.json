I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

This implies that the `Gold` count for Australia should be calculated as `Total - Silver - Bronze = 10 - 2 - 5 = 3`. \n\nTo perform this update, we need to execute an `UPDATE` SQL query that sets the `Silver`, `Bronze`, and `Total` columns for the row where `Nation` is \"Australia\". \n\nI will now execute the SQL query to update the table.\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The Olympic Medal Table for Australia has been updated to have 2 silver, 5 bronze, and a total of 10 medals.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Olympic Flag Bearers, and the headers of this table are #,Event year,Season,Ceremony,Flag bearer,Sport.\nQuestion: Change the sport of the first Olympic Flag Bearer to Basketball in the table 'Olympic Flag Bearers'.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Olympic Flag Bearers` SET Sport = 'Basketball' WHERE `Event year` = (SELECT MIN(`Event year`) FROM `Olympic Flag Bearers`);\"})\nTool: 1093 (HY000): You can't specify target table 'Olympic Flag Bearers' for update in FROM clause\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Olympic Flag Bearers` SET Sport = 'Basketball' WHERE `#` = 1;\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The sport of the first Olympic Flag Bearer has been changed to Basketball.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Squash Players Ranking, and the headers of this table are Rank,Player Name,No. of Titles,Runner-up,Final Appearances.\nQuestion: which player has the highest number of titles?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Player Name`, `No. of Titles` FROM `Squash Players Ranking` ORDER BY `No. of Titles` DESC LIMIT 1;\"}) To find the player with the highest number of titles, we need to query the `Player Name` and `No. of Titles` columns from the `Squash Players Ranking` table and sort the results by `No. of Titles` in descending order. The top result will give us the player with the highest number of titles.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('Jansher Khan', '8')]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Jansher Khan\"]}) The player with the highest number of titles is Jansher Khan, with 8 titles.\n\nI will now commit the final answer."
