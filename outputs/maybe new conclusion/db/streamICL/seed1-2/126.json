I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

The INSERT INTO query for this data would be: INSERT INTO 1952_British_Grand_Prix_0 (Pos, No, Driver, Constructor, Time, Gap) VALUES (22, 2, 'Tony Gaze', 'HWM - Alta', '2:02', '+12');\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO 1952_British_Grand_Prix_0 (Pos, No, Driver, Constructor, Time, Gap) VALUES (22, 2, 'Tony Gaze', 'HWM - Alta', '2:02', '+12');\"}) The question provides an `INSERT INTO` query for adding a record about Tony Gaze's performance in the 1952 British Grand Prix. This query is already correctly formatted to insert the specified data into the `1952_British_Grand_Prix_0` table.\n\nI will now execute the SQL query to insert the data into the table.\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The data about Tony Gaze's performance in the 1952 British Grand Prix has been successfully inserted into the `1952_British_Grand_Prix_0` table.\"]}) The data about Tony Gaze's performance in the 1952 British Grand Prix has been successfully inserted into the `1952_British_Grand_Prix_0` table.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is US Music Charts, and the headers of this table are Year,US Billboard,US Cash Box,US AC,CAN AC,Title.\nQuestion: What is the US cash box before 1978 with a US billboard of 35?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `US Cash Box` FROM `US Music Charts` WHERE Year < 1978 AND `US Billboard` = 35;\"})\nTool: [('18',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"18\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Nation Scores Table, and the headers of this table are Nation,T Score,A Score,E Score,Pen.,Total.\nQuestion: France's T Score is now 7.500, A Score is now 7.600, E Score is now 7.200, Pen. is 0.40 and Total is 22.700 in the Nation Scores Table.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Nation Scores Table` SET `T Score` = 7.500, `A Score` = 7.600, `E Score` = 7.200, `Pen.` = 0.40, `Total` = 22.700 WHERE Nation = 'France';\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"France's scores in the Nation Scores Table have been updated as follows: T Score = 7.500, A Score = 7.600, E Score = 7.200, Pen. = 0.40, and Total = 22.700.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Olympic Medal Table, and the headers of this table are Rank,Nation,Gold,Silver,Bronze,Total.\nQuestion: The Olympic Medal Table for Australia was updated to have 2 silver, 5 bronze, and a total of 10 medals.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Olympic Medal Table` SET Silver = 2, Bronze = 5, Total = 10 WHERE Nation = 'Australia';\"}) The question requires updating the `Olympic Medal Table` for Australia with specific values: 2 silver medals, 5 bronze medals, and a total of 10 medals. This implies that the `Gold` count for Australia should be calculated as `Total - Silver - Bronze = 10 - 2 - 5 = 3`. \n\nTo perform this update, we need to execute an `UPDATE` SQL query that sets the `Silver`, `Bronze`, and `Total` columns for the row where `Nation` is \"Australia\". \n\nI will now execute the SQL query to update the table.\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The Olympic Medal Table for Australia has been updated to have 2 silver, 5 bronze, and a total of 10 medals.\"]})"
