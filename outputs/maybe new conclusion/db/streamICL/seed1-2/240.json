I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

This can be achieved using an `UPDATE` SQL query with conditions on the specified columns.\n\nI will now execute the SQL query to update the `Notes` for the athlete's high jump records.\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The Notes for the athlete_high_jump_records of the World Championships in 2009 have been changed to '2.40 m'.\"]}) The `Notes` for the athlete's high jump records in the `World Championships` of `2009` have been successfully updated to '2.40 m'.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is highest_points, and the headers of this table are Rank,Country,Claimant,Highest point,Height.\nQuestion: What is the highest amount of points for rank 95?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Highest point` FROM `highest_points` WHERE Rank = 95 LIMIT 1;\"}) To find the highest amount of points for rank 95, we need to query the `Highest point` column from the `highest_points` table where the `Rank` is 95.\n\nI will now execute the SQL query to retrieve the highest amount of points for rank 95.\nTool: 1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near '= 95 LIMIT 1' at line 1\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"DESCRIBE `highest_points`;\"}) The error suggests there might be an issue with the `Rank` column's data type. It is possible that the `Rank` column is defined as a string (VARCHAR) instead of a numeric type. Let's check the data type of the `Rank` column in the `highest_points` table.\n\nI will now execute the SQL query to check the data type of the `Rank` column.\nTool: [('Rank', 'text', 'YES', '', None, ''), ('Country', 'text', 'YES', '', None, ''), ('Claimant', 'text', 'YES', '', None, ''), ('Highest point', 'text', 'YES', '', None, ''), ('Height', 'text', 'YES', '', None, '')]\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Highest point` FROM `highest_points` WHERE `Rank` = '95' LIMIT 1;\"}) The `Rank` column is of type `text`, which means it should be treated as a string. Therefore, I need to adjust the SQL query to use quotes around the value `95` when comparing it to the `Rank` column.\n\nI will now execute the corrected SQL query to retrieve the highest amount of points for rank 95.\nTool: [('Đeravica',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Đeravica\"]}) The highest amount of points for rank 95 is Đeravica.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Athletic Achievements, and the headers of this table are Year,Competition,Venue,Position,Event.\nQuestion: In the Athletic Achievements table, the Position column will be updated to '2nd', where the Year column is '2003', the Competition column is 'World Championships', and the Event column is '3000 m st.'\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Athletic Achievements` SET Position = '2nd' WHERE Year = '2003' AND Competition = 'World Championships' AND Event = '3000 m st.';\"}) The question requires updating the `Position` column to '2nd' in the `Athletic Achievements` table where the `Year` is '2003', the `Competition` is 'World Championships', and the `Event` is '3000 m st.'. This can be achieved using an `UPDATE` SQL query with conditions on the specified columns.\n\nI will now execute the SQL query to update the table.\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The `Position` column in the `Athletic Achievements` table has been updated to '2nd' where the `Year` is '2003', the `Competition` is 'World Championships', and the `Event` is '3000 m st.'.\"]}) The `Position` column in the `Athletic Achievements` table has been updated to '2nd' where the `Year` is '2003', the `Competition` is 'World Championships', and the `Event` is '3000 m st.'."
