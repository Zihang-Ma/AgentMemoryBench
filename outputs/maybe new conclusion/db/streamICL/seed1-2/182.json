I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

This can be achieved by using an `UPDATE` SQL query that targets the specific row where the `Game` is `9`.\n\nI will now execute the SQL query to update the game statistics for game 9.\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The game statistics for game 9 have been successfully updated with 'Dan Majerle (28)' as the high points and 'Charles Barkley (15)' as the high rebounds in the 'Game Statistics' table.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is game_results, and the headers of this table are Game,Date,Team,Score,High points,High rebounds,High assists,Location Attendance,Record.\nQuestion: What was the score against Portland in game numbers under 20?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Score FROM game_results WHERE Team = 'Portland' AND Game < 20;\"}) The question is asking for the score of games against Portland where the game number is less than 20. To answer this, we need to query the `Score` column from the `game_results` table where the `Team` is \"Portland\" and the `Game` number is less than 20.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('L 97–98 (OT)',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"L 97–98 (OT)\"]}) The query result shows that the score against Portland in game numbers under 20 was \"L 97–98 (OT)\".\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is football_standings, and the headers of this table are Position,Club,Games played,Wins,Draws,Loses,Goals scored,Goals conceded,Points.\nQuestion: What is the fewest number of games played?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT MIN(`Games played`) FROM football_standings;\"}) To find the fewest number of games played, we need to query the \"Games played\" column from the \"football_standings\" table and select the minimum value.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('34',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"34\"]}) The fewest number of games played is 34.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Athlete Performances, and the headers of this table are Year,Competition,Venue,Position,Event,Notes.\nQuestion: Insert a record into the table 'Athlete Performances' with the values '1996' for the year, 'Olympic Games' for the competition, 'Atlanta, USA' for the venue, '1st' for the position, 'Decathlon' for the event, and '8893 pts' for the notes.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `Athlete Performances` (Year, Competition, Venue, Position, Event, Notes) VALUES ('1996', 'Olympic Games', 'Atlanta, USA', '1st', 'Decathlon', '8893 pts');\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"A new row has been added to the `Athlete Performances` table with the values: Year '1996', Competition 'Olympic Games', Venue 'Atlanta, USA', Position '1st', Event 'Decathlon', and Notes '8893 pts'.\"]})"
