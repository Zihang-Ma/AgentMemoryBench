I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

To find this, we need to identify the game with the lowest value in the `Game` column that has the specified score. This can be achieved by querying the `Game` column and filtering for the score \"108-85,\" then selecting the minimum value of the `Game` column.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('80',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"80\"]}) The lowest game associated with the score \"108-85\" is game number 80.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is NBA Draft History, and the headers of this table are Round,Pick,Player,Position,Nationality,School/Club Team.\nQuestion: first player picked who attended school in california\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Player, Pick FROM `NBA Draft History` WHERE `School/Club Team` LIKE '%California%' ORDER BY Pick ASC LIMIT 1;\"}) The question asks for the first player picked in the NBA Draft History table who attended a school in California. To answer this, we need to query the `Player` and `Pick` columns from the `NBA Draft History` table where the `School/Club Team` column contains \"California\" and then find the player with the smallest `Pick` value (i.e., the first pick).\n\nI will first retrieve the relevant data to identify the first player picked from a school in California.\nTool: [('Michael Miley', '39')]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Michael Miley\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is game_results, and the headers of this table are Date,Opponent,Score,Loss,Attendance,Record.\nQuestion: On June 2, the team played against the Red Sox, with a final score of 3-2. The team suffered a loss, with Cotton having a record of 3-3. The game had an attendance of 30,000, bringing the team's overall record to 30-27. The game results were inserted into the database using the following values: Date='June 2', Opponent='Red Sox', Score='3 - 2', Loss='Cotton (3-3)', Attendance='30,000', and Record='30-27'.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO game_results (Date, Opponent, Score, Loss, Attendance, Record) VALUES ('June 2', 'Red Sox', '3 - 2', 'Cotton (3-3)', '30,000', '30-27');\"}) The question provides an `INSERT INTO` query for adding a record about a game result. The data includes the date, opponent, score, loss, attendance, and record. This query is already correctly formatted to insert the specified data into the `game_results` table.\n\nI will now execute the SQL query to insert the data into the table.\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The data about the game result has been successfully inserted into the `game_results` table.\"]}) The data about the game result has been successfully inserted into the `game_results` table.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Hockey_Game_Results, and the headers of this table are Date,Winning Team,Score,Losing Team,Score,OT,City,State/Province,Arena,Attendance.\nQuestion: did dallas or ottawa win the december 9, 1993 game?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Winning Team` FROM Hockey_Game_Results WHERE Date = 'December 9, 1993';\"}) To determine whether Dallas or Ottawa won the game on December 9, 1993, we need to query the `Hockey_Game_Results` table for the game on that date and check which team is listed as the `Winning Team`. \n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('Dallas',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Dallas\"]}) The winning team of the game on December 9, 1993, was Dallas.\n\nI will now commit the final answer."
