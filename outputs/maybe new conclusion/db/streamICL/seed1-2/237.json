I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

To answer this, we need to query the `Score` column from the `game_results` table where the `Team` is \"Portland\" and the `Game` number is less than 20.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('L 97–98 (OT)',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"L 97–98 (OT)\"]}) The query result shows that the score against Portland in game numbers under 20 was \"L 97–98 (OT)\".\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Game Records, and the headers of this table are Game,November,Opponent,Score,Record,Points.\nQuestion: Change the opponent value to 'New York Rangers' for the game with number '30' in the 'Game Records' table.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Game Records` SET Opponent = 'New York Rangers' WHERE Game = '30';\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The opponent value for game number 30 has been successfully updated to 'New York Rangers' in the 'Game Records' table.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Game Records, and the headers of this table are Game,February,Opponent,Score,Record.\nQuestion: Change the February record of Game 62 to 30 in the record database.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Game Records` SET February = '30' WHERE Game = '62';\"}) The question requires updating the `February` field for the game with number `62` in the `Game Records` table to the value `30`. This can be achieved using an `UPDATE` SQL query with a condition on the `Game` column.\n\nI will now execute the SQL query to update the `February` record for Game 62.\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The `February` record for Game 62 has been successfully updated to `30` in the `Game Records` table.\"]}) The `February` record for Game 62 has been successfully updated to `30` in the `Game Records` table.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Toronto Raptors Players, and the headers of this table are Player,No.,Nationality,Position,Years in Toronto,School/Club Team.\nQuestion: Change the 'School/Club Team' of Kyle Lowry in 'Toronto Raptors Players' to 'Cardinal Dougherty HS'.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Toronto Raptors Players` SET `School/Club Team` = 'Cardinal Dougherty HS' WHERE Player = 'Kyle Lowry';\"}) The question requires updating the `School/Club Team` field for the player \"Kyle Lowry\" in the `Toronto Raptors Players` table to \"Cardinal Dougherty HS\". This can be achieved by using an `UPDATE` SQL query that targets the specific row where the `Player` is \"Kyle Lowry\".\n\nI will now execute the SQL query to update Kyle Lowry's `School/Club Team` in the table.\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Kyle Lowry's 'School/Club Team' has been successfully changed to 'Cardinal Dougherty HS' in the 'Toronto Raptors Players' table.\"]})"
