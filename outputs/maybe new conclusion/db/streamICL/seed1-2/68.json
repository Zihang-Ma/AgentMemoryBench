I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

This can be achieved by using an `UPDATE` SQL query that targets the specific row(s) where the `Name` is \"John Smith\".\n\nI will now execute the SQL query to update the name in the table.\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The name in the draft_picks table has been modified from 'John Smith' to 'Johnny Smith'.\"]}) The name in the `draft_picks` table has been successfully updated from \"John Smith\" to \"Johnny Smith\".\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is NBA Draft History, and the headers of this table are Round,Pick,Player,Position,Nationality,School/Club Team.\nQuestion: first player picked who attended school in california\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Player, Pick FROM `NBA Draft History` WHERE `School/Club Team` LIKE '%California%' ORDER BY Pick ASC LIMIT 1;\"}) The question asks for the first player picked in the NBA Draft History table who attended a school in California. To answer this, we need to query the `Player` and `Pick` columns from the `NBA Draft History` table where the `School/Club Team` column contains \"California\" and then find the player with the smallest `Pick` value (i.e., the first pick).\n\nI will first retrieve the relevant data to identify the first player picked from a school in California.\nTool: [('Michael Miley', '39')]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Michael Miley\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is game_results, and the headers of this table are Game,Date,Team,Score,High points,High rebounds,High assists,Location Attendance,Record.\nQuestion: What was the score against Portland in game numbers under 20?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Score FROM game_results WHERE Team = 'Portland' AND Game < 20;\"}) The question is asking for the score of games against Portland where the game number is less than 20. To answer this, we need to query the `Score` column from the `game_results` table where the `Team` is \"Portland\" and the `Game` number is less than 20.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('L 97–98 (OT)',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"L 97–98 (OT)\"]}) The query result shows that the score against Portland in game numbers under 20 was \"L 97–98 (OT)\".\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Hockey_Game_Results, and the headers of this table are Date,Winning Team,Score,Losing Team,Score,OT,City,State/Province,Arena,Attendance.\nQuestion: did dallas or ottawa win the december 9, 1993 game?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Winning Team` FROM Hockey_Game_Results WHERE Date = 'December 9, 1993';\"}) To determine whether Dallas or Ottawa won the game on December 9, 1993, we need to query the `Hockey_Game_Results` table for the game on that date and check which team is listed as the `Winning Team`. \n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('Dallas',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Dallas\"]}) The winning team of the game on December 9, 1993, was Dallas.\n\nI will now commit the final answer."
