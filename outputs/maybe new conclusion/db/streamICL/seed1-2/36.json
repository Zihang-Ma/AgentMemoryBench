I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

To answer this, we need to query the `Player` and `Pick` columns from the `NBA Draft History` table where the `School/Club Team` column contains \"California\" and then find the player with the smallest `Pick` value (i.e., the first pick).\n\nI will first retrieve the relevant data to identify the first player picked from a school in California.\nTool: [('Michael Miley', '39')]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Michael Miley\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is draft_picks, and the headers of this table are Round,Pick #,Overall,Name,Position,College.\nQuestion: Modify the name in draft_picks table from 'John Smith' to 'Johnny Smith'.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE draft_picks SET Name = 'Johnny Smith' WHERE Name = 'John Smith';\"}) The question requires updating the `Name` field in the `draft_picks` table from \"John Smith\" to \"Johnny Smith\". This can be achieved by using an `UPDATE` SQL query that targets the specific row(s) where the `Name` is \"John Smith\".\n\nI will now execute the SQL query to update the name in the table.\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The name in the draft_picks table has been modified from 'John Smith' to 'Johnny Smith'.\"]}) The name in the `draft_picks` table has been successfully updated from \"John Smith\" to \"Johnny Smith\".\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Draft Picks, and the headers of this table are Pick,Round,Player,Position,School.\nQuestion: Change the position of draft picks in round 3 to Defensive Back.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Draft Picks` SET Position = 'Defensive Back' WHERE Round = 3;\"}) The question requires updating the `Position` field for all draft picks in the `Draft Picks` table where the `Round` is 3 to \"Defensive Back\". This can be achieved by using an `UPDATE` SQL query that targets the specific rows where the `Round` is 3.\n\nI will now execute the SQL query to update the position of draft picks in round 3.\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The position of draft picks in round 3 has been successfully changed to Defensive Back in the Draft Picks table.\"]}) The position of all draft picks in round 3 has been successfully changed to \"Defensive Back\" in the `Draft Picks` table.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is hockey_players, and the headers of this table are Pick #,Player,Nationality,Position,Team from,League from.\nQuestion: What is the total pick # for the D position from a team from Chilliwack Bruins?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT SUM(`Pick #`) AS TotalPick FROM hockey_players WHERE Position = 'D' AND `Team from` = 'Chilliwack Bruins';\"}) The question asks for the total pick number for players in the \"D\" position who were drafted from the \"Chilliwack Bruins\" team. To answer this, we need to query the `Pick #` column from the `hockey_players` table where the `Position` is \"D\" and the `Team from` is \"Chilliwack Bruins\" and then sum those pick numbers.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [(167.0,)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"167\"]}) The total pick number for players in the \"D\" position from the \"Chilliwack Bruins\" team is 167.\n\nI will now commit the final answer."
