I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

To answer this, we need to query the `Raiders first downs` column for the specific game number and count the distinct values.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [(1,)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"1\"]}) The query result shows that there is 1 distinct count of \"Raiders first downs\" for game number 9.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is hockey_players, and the headers of this table are Pick #,Player,Nationality,Position,Team from,League from.\nQuestion: What is the total pick # for the D position from a team from Chilliwack Bruins?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT SUM(`Pick #`) AS TotalPick FROM hockey_players WHERE Position = 'D' AND `Team from` = 'Chilliwack Bruins';\"}) The question asks for the total pick number for players in the \"D\" position who were drafted from the \"Chilliwack Bruins\" team. To answer this, we need to query the `Pick #` column from the `hockey_players` table where the `Position` is \"D\" and the `Team from` is \"Chilliwack Bruins\" and then sum those pick numbers.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [(167.0,)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"167\"]}) The total pick number for players in the \"D\" position from the \"Chilliwack Bruins\" team is 167.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Game Statistics, and the headers of this table are Game,Date,Team,Score,High points,High rebounds,High assists,Location Attendance,Series.\nQuestion: Update the game statistics for game 9 by setting the high points to 'Dan Majerle (28)' and the high rebounds to 'Charles Barkley (15)'.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Game Statistics` SET `High points` = 'Dan Majerle (28)', `High rebounds` = 'Charles Barkley (15)' WHERE Game = '9';\"}) The question requires updating the `High points` and `High rebounds` fields for the game with number `9` in the `Game Statistics` table to the values \"Dan Majerle (28)\" and \"Charles Barkley (15)\", respectively. This can be achieved by using an `UPDATE` SQL query that targets the specific row where the `Game` is `9`.\n\nI will now execute the SQL query to update the game statistics for game 9.\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The game statistics for game 9 have been successfully updated with 'Dan Majerle (28)' as the high points and 'Charles Barkley (15)' as the high rebounds in the 'Game Statistics' table.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is game_results, and the headers of this table are Game,Date,Team,Score,High points,High rebounds,High assists,Location Attendance,Record.\nQuestion: What was the score against Portland in game numbers under 20?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Score FROM game_results WHERE Team = 'Portland' AND Game < 20;\"}) The question is asking for the score of games against Portland where the game number is less than 20. To answer this, we need to query the `Score` column from the `game_results` table where the `Team` is \"Portland\" and the `Game` number is less than 20.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('L 97–98 (OT)',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"L 97–98 (OT)\"]}) The query result shows that the score against Portland in game numbers under 20 was \"L 97–98 (OT)\".\n\nI will now commit the final answer."
