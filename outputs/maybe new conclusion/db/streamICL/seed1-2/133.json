I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

Then, we can calculate the average of those years.\n\nI will start by querying the years where the entrant is \"Belanger Motors\" and the engine is \"Offenhauser L4\".\nTool: [('1956',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"1956\"]}) The query result shows that Belanger Motors had an Offenhauser L4 engine in the year 1956. Since there is only one year, the average year is also 1956.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is airlines, and the headers of this table are Airline,ICAO,IATA,Callsign,Commenced operations,Fleet size,Headquarters.\nQuestion: When did the oldest airline start operations?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT MIN(`Commenced operations`) FROM `airlines`;\"}) To determine when the oldest airline started operations, we need to find the minimum value in the `Commenced operations` column from the `airlines` table. This will give us the earliest year an airline started operations.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('1941',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"1941\"]}) The oldest airline started operations in the year 1941.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Game Records, and the headers of this table are Game,November,Opponent,Score,Record,Points.\nQuestion: Change the opponent value to 'New York Rangers' for the game with number '30' in the 'Game Records' table.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Game Records` SET Opponent = 'New York Rangers' WHERE Game = '30';\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The opponent value for game number 30 has been successfully updated to 'New York Rangers' in the 'Game Records' table.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Football_Stats, and the headers of this table are Season,Team,Country,Division,Apps,Goals.\nQuestion: what was the number of apps for spartak nizhy novgorod?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Apps FROM Football_Stats WHERE Team = 'Spartak Nizhny Novgorod';\"}) To find the number of apps for Spartak Nizhny Novgorod, we need to query the \"Apps\" column from the \"Football_Stats\" table where the \"Team\" is 'Spartak Nizhny Novgorod'.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('36',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"36\"]}) The number of apps for Spartak Nizhny Novgorod is 36.\n\nI will now commit the final answer."
