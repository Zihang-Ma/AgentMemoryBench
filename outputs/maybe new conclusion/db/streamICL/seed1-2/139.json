I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

This will give us the earliest year an airline started operations.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('1941',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"1941\"]}) The oldest airline started operations in the year 1941.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is SWAT Games, and the headers of this table are Title,Year,Platform,Developer,Publisher.\nQuestion: Name the plaform for year more than 2006 and developer of 3g studios\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Platform FROM `SWAT Games` WHERE Year > 2006 AND Developer = '3g studios';\"}) The question is asking for the platform of games developed by \"3g studios\" that were released in a year greater than 2006. To answer this, we need to filter the `SWAT Games` table using the `Year` and `Developer` columns and then retrieve the corresponding `Platform` values.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('PlayStation Portable',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"PlayStation Portable\"]}) The platform for the game developed by \"3g studios\" and released in a year greater than 2006 is \"PlayStation Portable\".\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is racers_database, and the headers of this table are Year,Entrant,Chassis,Engine,Points.\nQuestion: What is the average year that the Belanger Motors had an Offenhauser l4 engine?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Year FROM racers_database WHERE Entrant = 'Belanger Motors' AND Engine = 'Offenhauser l4';\"}) To find the average year that Belanger Motors had an Offenhauser L4 engine, we need to first retrieve all the years where the entrant is \"Belanger Motors\" and the engine is \"Offenhauser L4\" from the `racers_database` table. Then, we can calculate the average of those years.\n\nI will start by querying the years where the entrant is \"Belanger Motors\" and the engine is \"Offenhauser L4\".\nTool: [('1956',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"1956\"]}) The query result shows that Belanger Motors had an Offenhauser L4 engine in the year 1956. Since there is only one year, the average year is also 1956.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Wine_Houses, and the headers of this table are House,Founding Year,Location,Cuvée,Company.\nQuestion: Change the Cuvée to 'Brut Réserve' for the Wine_Houses where the House is 'Pol Roger'\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Wine_Houses` SET Cuvée = 'Brut Réserve' WHERE House = 'Pol Roger';\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The Cuvée for the Wine_Houses where the House is 'Pol Roger' has been changed to 'Brut Réserve'.\"]})"
