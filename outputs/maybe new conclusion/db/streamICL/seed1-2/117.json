I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

      "content": "Here are some examples of the task you have completed:\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Soccer Team Performance Table, and the headers of this table are Year,Division,League,Regular Season,Playoffs,Open Cup.\nQuestion: other than npsl, what league has ny mens soccer team played in?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT League FROM `Soccer Team Performance Table` WHERE Name = 'NY Men''s Soccer Team';\"}) The question asks for the league that the NY men's soccer team has played in, excluding \"NPSL.\" To answer this, we need to query the \"League\" column from the \"Soccer Team Performance Table\" where the \"Name\" of the team is \"NY Men's Soccer Team\" and filter out any rows where the \"League\" is \"NPSL.\"\n\nI will first check if there is a specific \"Name\" for the NY men's soccer team in the table. If not, I will need to adjust the query accordingly. \n\nLet me start by retrieving the \"League\" values for the NY men's soccer team. \n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: 1054 (42S22): Unknown column 'Name' in 'where clause'\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT * FROM `Soccer Team Performance Table` LIMIT 10;\"}) The error indicates that the column \"Name\" does not exist in the \"Soccer Team Performance Table.\" This means I need to adjust the query to use the correct column name that represents the team's name. Since the column \"Name\" is not present, I will assume that the team's name might be represented in another column, such as \"Regular Season\" or \"Playoffs,\" or that the table might not have a specific column for team names.\n\nI will now attempt to find the league by checking the data in the table and identifying the correct column that might contain the team's name. Let me first retrieve all the data from the table to understand its structure better.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('2008', '4', 'NPSL', '2nd, Mid Atlantic', 'Did not qualify', 'Did not qualify'), ('2009', '4', 'NPSL', '5th, Atlantic', 'Did not qualify', 'Did not enter'), ('2010', '4', 'NPSL', '5th, Atlantic', 'Did not qualify', 'Did not enter'), ('2010–11', '5', 'CSL I', 'In progress', 'N/A', 'N/A'), ('2011', '4', 'NPSL', '4th, Atlantic', 'Did not qualify', 'Did not enter'), ('2012', '4', 'NPSL', '3rd, Atlantic', 'Did not qualify', 'Did not enter'), ('2013', '4', 'NPSL', '3rd, Atlantic', 'Did not qualify',...\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"CSL I\"]}) From the data retrieved, it appears that the \"Name\" of the team is not explicitly listed in the table. However, the data shows that the team has played in the \"NPSL\" league in several years. The question asks for the league other than \"NPSL\" that the NY men's soccer team has played in.\n\nLooking at the data, in the year \"2010–11,\" the team played in \"CSL I\" (Continental Soccer League I). This is the only instance where the team played in a league other than \"NPSL.\"\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is standings, and the headers of this table are Position,Name,Played,Drawn,Lost,Points.\nQuestion: Update the points of ESC Kempten II (N) in the standings table to 6.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE standings SET Points = 6 WHERE Name = 'ESC Kempten II (N)' LIMIT 1;\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The points of ESC Kempten II (N) have been updated to 6 in the standings table.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Figure Skating Competitors, and the headers of this table are Rank,Name,Nation,Total Points,SP,FS.\nQuestion: Update the total points of the figure skating competitor ranked 22 to 195.67 in the 'Figure Skating Competitors' table.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Figure Skating Competitors` SET `Total Points` = 195.67 WHERE Rank = 22 LIMIT 1;\"})\nTool: 1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near '= 22 LIMIT 1' at line 1\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Figure Skating Competitors` SET `Total Points` = 195.67 WHERE Rank = '22' LIMIT 1;\"})\nTool: 1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near '= '22' LIMIT 1' at line 1\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Figure Skating Competitors` SET `Total Points` = 195.67 WHERE Rank = 22;\"})\nTool: 1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near '= 22' at line 1\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"ALTER TABLE `Figure Skating Competitors` MODIFY `Rank` VARCHAR(255);\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Figure Skating Competitors` SET `Total Points` = 195.67 WHERE `Rank` = '22' LIMIT 1;\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The total points of the figure skating competitor ranked 22 have been updated to 195.67 in the 'Figure Skating Competitors' table.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Nation Scores Table, and the headers of this table are Nation,T Score,A Score,E Score,Pen.,Total.\nQuestion: France's T Score is now 7.500, A Score is now 7.600, E Score is now 7.200, Pen. is 0.40 and Total is 22.700 in the Nation Scores Table.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Nation Scores Table` SET `T Score` = 7.500, `A Score` = 7.600, `E Score` = 7.200, `Pen.` = 0.40, `Total` = 22.700 WHERE Nation = 'France';\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"France's scores in the Nation Scores Table have been updated as follows: T Score = 7.500, A Score = 7.600, E Score = 7.200, Pen. = 0.40, and Total = 22.700.\"]})"
