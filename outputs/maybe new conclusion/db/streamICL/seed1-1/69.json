I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

      "content": "Here are some examples of the task you have completed:\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Racing Stats, and the headers of this table are Year,Starts,Wins,Top 5,Top 10,Poles,Avg. Start,Avg. Finish,Winnings,Position,Team(s).\nQuestion: Name the avg finish for position of 70th\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Avg. Finish` FROM `Racing Stats` WHERE `Position` = 70;\"}) To find the average finish for the position of 70th in the `Racing Stats` table, I need to:\n\n1. Filter the rows in the `Racing Stats` table where the `Position` is 70th.\n2. Retrieve the corresponding `Avg. Finish` value for these rows.\n\nI will start by querying the `Avg. Finish` values for the specified position.\nTool: [('36.0',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"36.0\"]}) The SQL query result shows that the average finish for the position of 70th is 36.0.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Winners By Country, and the headers of this table are Winner,Country,Most Recent Win.\nQuestion: The `Winners By Country` table is being updated by adding the values '3' for `Winner`, 'Spain' for `Country`, and '2005' for `Most Recent Win`.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `Winners By Country` (`Winner`, `Country`, `Most Recent Win`) VALUES (3, 'Spain', 2005);\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The data has been successfully inserted into the Winners By Country table.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Motorcycle Race Results, and the headers of this table are Rider,Manufacturer,Laps,Time/Retired,Grid.\nQuestion: What is the average number of laps with an accident time/retired, aprilia manufacturer and a grid of 27?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Laps` FROM `Motorcycle Race Results` WHERE `Time/Retired` = 'accident' AND `Manufacturer` = 'Aprilia' AND `Grid` = 27;\"}) To find the average number of laps for entries with an \"accident\" time/retired, \"Aprilia\" manufacturer, and a grid of 27, I need to:\n\n1. Filter the rows in the `Motorcycle Race Results` table where:\n   - `Time/Retired` is \"accident\",\n   - `Manufacturer` is \"Aprilia\", and\n   - `Grid` is 27.\n2. Calculate the average of the `Laps` column for these filtered rows.\n\nI will start by querying the `Laps` values for the specified conditions. \n\nThe SQL query to execute is:\nTool: [('12',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"12\"]}) The SQL query result shows that there is one entry with the specified conditions, and the number of laps is 12. Since there is only one entry, the average number of laps is also 12.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Football Matches, and the headers of this table are Tie no,Home team,Score,Away team,Attendance.\nQuestion: How many attended tie number 19?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Attendance` FROM `Football Matches` WHERE `Tie no` = 19;\"}) To find the attendance for tie number 19, I need to query the `Football Matches` table for the row where `Tie no` is 19 and then retrieve the `Attendance` value. This can be achieved using a `SELECT` statement with a `WHERE` clause to filter the rows based on the specified condition.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('1,174',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"1,174\"]}) The attendance for tie number 19 is 1,174.\n\nI will now commit the final answer."
