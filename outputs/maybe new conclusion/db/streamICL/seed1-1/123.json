I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

This can be achieved using the `MIN()` function in SQL.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('1941',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"1941\"]}) The oldest airline started operations in the year 1941.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Schools, and the headers of this table are Institution,Location,Affiliation,Enrollment,Mascot,Colors.\nQuestion: Insert into Schools table with values including Institution as 'Aquinas', Location as 'La Crosse', Affiliation as 'Private', Enrollment as '312', Mascot as 'Blugolds', and Colors as 'Navy and gold'.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `Schools` (Institution, Location, Affiliation, Enrollment, Mascot, Colors) VALUES ('Aquinas', 'La Crosse', 'Private', '312', 'Blugolds', 'Navy and gold');\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The data has been successfully inserted into the Schools table.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Tallest Buildings in Minneapolis, and the headers of this table are Name,Street address,Years as tallest,Height ft (m),Floors.\nQuestion: Alter the `Floors` value to '69' for the building named 'Capella Tower' in the table `Tallest Buildings in Minneapolis`.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Tallest Buildings in Minneapolis` SET `Floors` = '69' WHERE `Name` = 'Capella Tower';\"}) To update the `Floors` value to '69' for the building named 'Capella Tower' in the `Tallest Buildings in Minneapolis` table, I will use the `UPDATE` SQL statement. This allows me to change the value in the `Floors` column for the row where the `Name` is 'Capella Tower'.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The `Floors` value for the building named 'Capella Tower' has been successfully updated to '69' in the `Tallest Buildings in Minneapolis` table.\"]})"
