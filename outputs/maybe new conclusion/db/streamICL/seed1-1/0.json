I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

This can be done using the `MAX()` function in SQL along with a `WHERE` clause to filter the player with that maximum number of titles.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('Jansher Khan',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Jansher Khan\"]}) The player with the highest number of titles is Jansher Khan.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Athlete_results, and the headers of this table are Year,Competition,Venue,Position,Event,Notes.\nQuestion: In the table Athlete_results, a row is inserted with the values '2008' for Year, 'Olympic Games' for Competition, 'Beijing, China' for Venue, '1st' for Position, '800 metres' for Event, and '-' for Notes.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `Athlete_results` (Year, Competition, Venue, Position, Event, Notes) VALUES ('2008', 'Olympic Games', 'Beijing, China', '1st', '800 metres', '-');\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The data has been successfully inserted into the Athlete_results table.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Music Releases, and the headers of this table are Release,Artist,Title,Notes,Album.\nQuestion: what year was the first title released?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT MIN(`Release`) AS first_release_year FROM `Music Releases`;\"}) To find the year the first title was released, I need to identify the minimum value in the `Release` column of the `Music Releases` table. This can be achieved using the `MIN()` function in SQL.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('2004',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"2004\"]}) The first title was released in the year 2004.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is football_standings, and the headers of this table are Position,Club,Games played,Wins,Draws,Loses,Goals scored,Goals conceded,Points.\nQuestion: What is the fewest number of games played?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT MIN(`Games played`) AS fewest_games FROM football_standings;\"}) To find the fewest number of games played in the `football_standings` table, I need to query the minimum value from the `Games played` column. This can be done using the `MIN()` function in SQL.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('34',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"34\"]}) The fewest number of games played is 34.\n\nI will now commit the final answer."
