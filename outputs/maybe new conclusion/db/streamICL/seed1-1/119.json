I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

      "content": "Here are some examples of the task you have completed:\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Game Records, and the headers of this table are Game,November,Opponent,Score,Record,Points.\nQuestion: Change the opponent value to 'New York Rangers' for the game with number '30' in the 'Game Records' table.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Game Records` SET `Opponent` = 'New York Rangers' WHERE `Game` = '30';\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The opponent for the game with number '30' has been successfully updated to 'New York Rangers'.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Team Information, and the headers of this table are Team,Location,Stadium,Capacity.\nQuestion: Modify the capacity of the 'Princeton Tigers' team in the 'Team Information' table to '45,000'.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Team Information` SET `Capacity` = '45,000' WHERE `Team` = 'Princeton Tigers';\"}) To modify the capacity of the 'Princeton Tigers' team in the 'Team Information' table to '45,000', I will use the `UPDATE` SQL statement. This allows me to change the value in the `Capacity` column for the row where the `Team` is 'Princeton Tigers'.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The capacity of the 'Princeton Tigers' team has been successfully updated to '45,000'.\"]}) The capacity of the 'Princeton Tigers' team in the 'Team Information' table has been successfully updated to '45,000'.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Soccer Team Performance Table, and the headers of this table are Year,Division,League,Regular Season,Playoffs,Open Cup.\nQuestion: other than npsl, what league has ny mens soccer team played in?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `League` FROM `Soccer Team Performance Table` WHERE `Team` = 'NY Men''s Soccer Team';\"}) To find out which league the NY men's soccer team has played in other than the NPSL, I need to query the `Soccer Team Performance Table` for rows where the `League` is not 'NPSL' and the `Team` is 'NY Men's Soccer Team'. Then, I can retrieve the `League` values from those rows.\n\nI will start by checking if there is a record for the 'NY Men's Soccer Team' in the table. If there is, I can then filter out the 'NPSL' league and find the other leagues they have played in.\n\nLet's first check if the 'NY Men's Soccer Team' exists in the table.\nTool: 1054 (42S22): Unknown column 'Team' in 'where clause'\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `League` FROM `Soccer Team Performance Table` WHERE `League` != 'NPSL';\"}) It seems that the `Team` column does not exist in the `Soccer Team Performance Table`. I need to adjust my query to find the leagues that the NY men's soccer team has played in, using the available columns.\n\nLet me try querying the `League` column directly to see if there are any entries related to the NY men's soccer team.\nTool: [('CSL I',), ('CSL I',), ('CSL I',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"CSL I\"]}) It appears that the `Soccer Team Performance Table` contains entries for the 'CSL I' league, but there is no specific mention of the 'NY Men's Soccer Team'. Since the `Team` column is not available, I cannot directly filter for the team. However, based on the information provided, the only league other than 'NPSL' mentioned in the table is 'CSL I'.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is athlete_performance, and the headers of this table are Year,Competition,Venue,Position,Event,Notes.\nQuestion: Update the athlete's performance data in the 'athlete_performance' table for the '3000 m' event where the athlete finished in '2nd' position. Set the year to '1998', competition to 'Commonwealth Games', venue to 'Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia', position to '1st', and notes to '8:37.92'.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `athlete_performance` SET `Year` = '1998', `Competition` = 'Commonwealth Games', `Venue` = 'Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia', `Position` = '1st', `Notes` = '8:37.92' WHERE `Event` = '3000 m' AND `Position` = '2nd';\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The athlete's performance data for the '3000 m' event where the athlete finished in '2nd' position has been successfully updated with the new values: Year '1998', Competition 'Commonwealth Games', Venue 'Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia', Position '1st', and Notes '8:37.92'.\"]})"
