I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

This can be achieved using a `SELECT` statement with a `WHERE` clause to filter the rows based on the specified condition.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('1,174',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"1,174\"]}) The attendance for tie number 19 is 1,174.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is football_standings, and the headers of this table are Position,Club,Games played,Wins,Draws,Loses,Goals scored,Goals conceded,Points.\nQuestion: What is the fewest number of games played?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT MIN(`Games played`) AS fewest_games FROM football_standings;\"}) To find the fewest number of games played in the `football_standings` table, I need to query the minimum value from the `Games played` column. This can be done using the `MIN()` function in SQL.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('34',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"34\"]}) The fewest number of games played is 34.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Athlete Performances, and the headers of this table are Year,Competition,Venue,Position,Event,Notes.\nQuestion: Insert a record into the table 'Athlete Performances' with the values '1996' for the year, 'Olympic Games' for the competition, 'Atlanta, USA' for the venue, '1st' for the position, 'Decathlon' for the event, and '8893 pts' for the notes.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `Athlete Performances` (Year, Competition, Venue, Position, Event, Notes) VALUES ('1996', 'Olympic Games', 'Atlanta, USA', '1st', 'Decathlon', '8893 pts');\"}) The task is to insert a new row into the `Athlete Performances` table with the specified values: '1996' for Year, 'Olympic Games' for Competition, 'Atlanta, USA' for Venue, '1st' for Position, 'Decathlon' for Event, and '8893 pts' for Notes.
