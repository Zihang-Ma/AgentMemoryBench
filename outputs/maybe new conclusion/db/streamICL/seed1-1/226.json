I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

This can be achieved using the `MIN()` function in SQL.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('1976',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"1976\"]}) The earliest any of these players were born is 1976.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Game Statistics, and the headers of this table are Game,Date,Team,Score,High points,High rebounds,High assists,Location Attendance,Series.\nQuestion: Update the game statistics for game 9 by setting the high points to 'Dan Majerle (28)' and the high rebounds to 'Charles Barkley (15)'.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Game Statistics` SET `High points` = 'Dan Majerle (28)', `High rebounds` = 'Charles Barkley (15)' WHERE `Game` = 9;\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The game statistics for game 9 have been successfully updated with High points = 'Dan Majerle (28)' and High rebounds = 'Charles Barkley (15)'.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is NBA Draft History, and the headers of this table are Round,Pick,Player,Position,Nationality,School/Club Team.\nQuestion: first player picked who attended school in california\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Player FROM `NBA Draft History` WHERE `School/Club Team` LIKE '%California%' ORDER BY Pick ASC LIMIT 1;\"}) To find the first player picked who attended school in California, I need to query the `NBA Draft History` table for the player with the minimum `Pick` value where the `School/Club Team` is in California.
