I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

This can be achieved using the `MIN()` function in SQL.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('2004',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"2004\"]}) The first title was released in the year 2004.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is US Music Charts, and the headers of this table are Year,US Billboard,US Cash Box,US AC,CAN AC,Title.\nQuestion: What is the US cash box before 1978 with a US billboard of 35?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `US Cash Box` FROM `US Music Charts` WHERE `US Billboard` = 35 AND `Year` < 1978;\"}) To find the value of the `US Cash Box` for entries in the `US Music Charts` table where the `US Billboard` is 35 and the `Year` is before 1978, I will use a `SELECT` query with a `WHERE` clause to filter the data based on the given conditions.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('18',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"18\"]}) The value of the `US Cash Box` before 1978 with a `US Billboard` of 35 is 18.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Olympic Medals, and the headers of this table are Rank,Nation,Gold,Silver,Bronze,Total.\nQuestion: what is the average number of gold medals won by china, japan, and north korea?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Gold` FROM `Olympic Medals` WHERE Nation IN ('China', 'Japan', 'North Korea');\"}) To calculate the average number of gold medals won by China, Japan, and North Korea, I need to:\n\n1. Retrieve the number of gold medals for each of these three nations from the `Olympic Medals` table.\n2. Compute the average of these values.\n\nI will start by querying the gold medals for China, Japan, and North Korea. \n\nThe SQL query to execute is:\nTool: [('13',), ('7',), ('1',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"7\"]}) The SQL query returned the number of gold medals for China, Japan, and North Korea as 13, 7, and 1 respectively. \n\nNow, I will calculate the average of these values.\n\nThe average number of gold medals is (13 + 7 + 1) / 3 = 21 / 3 = 7.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Player Stats, and the headers of this table are Player,G,Tackles,Solo,Assts,Sacks,Int,Int yards,Int avg.,Int TD,Fum. rec,Fum. rec TD.\nQuestion: Name the least int yards when sacks is 11.5\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT MIN(`Int yards`) AS least_int_yards FROM `Player Stats` WHERE `Sacks` = 11.5;\"}) To find the least `Int yards` when `Sacks` is 11.5, I need to query the `Player Stats` table for rows where `Sacks` equals 11.5 and then retrieve the minimum value of `Int yards` from those rows. This can be achieved using a `SELECT` statement with the `MIN()` function and a `WHERE` clause to filter the rows with `Sacks = 11.5`.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('41',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"41\"]}) The least `Int yards` when `Sacks` is 11.5 is 41.\n\nI will now commit the final answer."
