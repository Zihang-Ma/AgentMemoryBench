I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

To find this, I need to query the `raiders_game_stats` table for rows where `Game` is 9 and then count the unique values in the `Raiders first downs` column. This can be achieved using a `SELECT` statement with the `COUNT(DISTINCT)` function and a `WHERE` clause to filter the rows with `Game = 9`.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [(1,)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"1\"]}) The query result shows that there is 1 distinct count of `Raiders first downs` for game number 9. \n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is hockey_players, and the headers of this table are Pick #,Player,Nationality,Position,Team from,League from.\nQuestion: What is the total pick # for the D position from a team from Chilliwack Bruins?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT SUM(`Pick #`) AS total_pick FROM hockey_players WHERE `Position` = 'D' AND `Team from` = 'Chilliwack Bruins';\"}) To find the total pick # for the D position from a team from Chilliwack Bruins, I need to query the `hockey_players` table for rows where `Position` is 'D' and `Team from` is 'Chilliwack Bruins', and then sum the values in the `Pick #` column. This can be achieved using a `SELECT` statement with the `SUM()` function and `WHERE` clauses to filter the rows with the specified `Position` and `Team from`.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [(167.0,)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"167\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Racing Stats, and the headers of this table are Year,Starts,Wins,Top 5,Top 10,Poles,Avg. Start,Avg. Finish,Winnings,Position,Team(s).\nQuestion: Name the avg finish for position of 70th\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Avg. Finish` FROM `Racing Stats` WHERE `Position` = 70;\"}) To find the average finish for the position of 70th in the `Racing Stats` table, I need to:\n\n1. Filter the rows in the `Racing Stats` table where the `Position` is 70th.\n2. Retrieve the corresponding `Avg. Finish` value for these rows.\n\nI will start by querying the `Avg. Finish` values for the specified position.\nTool: [('36.0',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"36.0\"]}) The SQL query result shows that the average finish for the position of 70th is 36.0.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is game_results, and the headers of this table are Game,Date,Team,Score,High points,High rebounds,High assists,Location Attendance,Record.\nQuestion: What was the score against Portland in game numbers under 20?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Score` FROM `game_results` WHERE `Game` < 20 AND `Team` = 'Portland';\"}) To find the score against Portland in game numbers under 20, I need to query the `game_results` table for rows where the `Game` number is less than 20 and the `Team` is 'Portland', then retrieve the `Score` value. This can be achieved using a `SELECT` statement with `WHERE` clauses to filter the rows based on the specified conditions.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('L 97–98 (OT)',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"L 97–98 (OT)\"]}) The score against Portland in game numbers under 20 is \"L 97–98 (OT)\".\n\nI will now commit the final answer."
