I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

      "content": "Here are some examples of the task you have completed:\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Footballers, and the headers of this table are Season,Footballer,Club,Position,Nationality.\nQuestion: Change Andile Jali's position to DF in the Footballers table.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Footballers` SET `Position` = 'DF' WHERE `Footballer` = 'Andile Jali';\"}) To change Andile Jali's position to \"DF\" in the Footballers table, I will use the `UPDATE` SQL statement. This allows me to modify the value in the `Position` column for the row where the `Footballer` is \"Andile Jali\".\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Andile Jali's position has been successfully updated to DF in the Footballers table.\"]}) The position of Andile Jali in the Footballers table has been successfully updated to \"DF\".\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Soccer Team Performance Table, and the headers of this table are Year,Division,League,Regular Season,Playoffs,Open Cup.\nQuestion: other than npsl, what league has ny mens soccer team played in?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `League` FROM `Soccer Team Performance Table` WHERE `Team` = 'NY Men''s Soccer Team';\"}) To find out which league the NY men's soccer team has played in other than the NPSL, I need to query the `Soccer Team Performance Table` for rows where the `League` is not 'NPSL' and the `Team` is 'NY Men's Soccer Team'. Then, I can retrieve the `League` values from those rows.\n\nI will start by checking if there is a record for the 'NY Men's Soccer Team' in the table. If there is, I can then filter out the 'NPSL' league and find the other leagues they have played in.\n\nLet's first check if the 'NY Men's Soccer Team' exists in the table.\nTool: 1054 (42S22): Unknown column 'Team' in 'where clause'\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `League` FROM `Soccer Team Performance Table` WHERE `League` != 'NPSL';\"}) It seems that the `Team` column does not exist in the `Soccer Team Performance Table`. I need to adjust my query to find the leagues that the NY men's soccer team has played in, using the available columns.\n\nLet me try querying the `League` column directly to see if there are any entries related to the NY men's soccer team.\nTool: [('CSL I',), ('CSL I',), ('CSL I',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"CSL I\"]}) It appears that the `Soccer Team Performance Table` contains entries for the 'CSL I' league, but there is no specific mention of the 'NY Men's Soccer Team'. Since the `Team` column is not available, I cannot directly filter for the team. However, based on the information provided, the only league other than 'NPSL' mentioned in the table is 'CSL I'.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Game Records, and the headers of this table are Game,November,Opponent,Score,Record,Points.\nQuestion: Change the opponent value to 'New York Rangers' for the game with number '30' in the 'Game Records' table.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Game Records` SET `Opponent` = 'New York Rangers' WHERE `Game` = '30';\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The opponent for the game with number '30' has been successfully updated to 'New York Rangers'.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is draft_picks, and the headers of this table are Round,Pick #,Overall,Name,Position,College.\nQuestion: Modify the name in draft_picks table from 'John Smith' to 'Johnny Smith'.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE draft_picks SET Name = 'Johnny Smith' WHERE Name = 'John Smith';\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The name 'John Smith' has been successfully modified to 'Johnny Smith' in the draft_picks table.\"]})"
