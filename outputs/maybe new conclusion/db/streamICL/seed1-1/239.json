I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

This can be done using the `MIN()` function in SQL.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('34',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"34\"]}) The fewest number of games played is 34.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is NFL Team Records Table, and the headers of this table are Num,Team,W,L,PCT,PF,PA,Last appearance,Last championship,HOME games,Home wins,Home losses,Home Win Pct.,ROAD games,Road wins,Road losses,Road Win Pct..\nQuestion: How many home losses occured when PF 13?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT COUNT(`Home losses`) AS home_losses_count FROM `NFL Team Records Table` WHERE `PF` = 13;\"}) The question is asking for the number of home losses that occurred when the \"PF\" (Points For) value is 13. To answer this, I need to query the `NFL Team Records Table` for rows where `PF = 13` and then count the number of entries in the `Home losses` column. This can be achieved using a `SELECT` statement with a `WHERE` clause to filter the rows based on the specified condition and then using the `COUNT()` function to count the number of home losses.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [(1,)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"1\"]}) The query result shows that there is 1 home loss when the \"PF\" (Points For) value is 13.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Football Matches, and the headers of this table are Tie no,Home team,Score,Away team,Attendance.\nQuestion: How many attended tie number 19?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Attendance` FROM `Football Matches` WHERE `Tie no` = 19;\"}) To find the attendance for tie number 19, I need to query the `Football Matches` table for the row where `Tie no` is 19 and then retrieve the `Attendance` value. This can be achieved using a `SELECT` statement with a `WHERE` clause to filter the rows based on the specified condition.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('1,174',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"1,174\"]}) The attendance for tie number 19 is 1,174.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Ranking and Results Table for AFC Cup, and the headers of this table are Rank,Member Association,Points,Group stage,Play-off,AFC Cup.\nQuestion: Insert values into 'Ranking and Results Table for AFC Cup' table for Myanmar with rank 11, 30.0 points, 0 group stage appearances, 1 play-off appearance, and 1 AFC cup appearance.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `Ranking and Results Table for AFC Cup` (Rank, Member Association, Points, Group stage, Play-off, AFC Cup) VALUES (11, 'Myanmar', 30.0, 0, 1, 1);\"}) To insert the specified values into the 'Ranking and Results Table for AFC Cup' table for Myanmar, I will use the `INSERT INTO` SQL statement. The values to be inserted are: Rank 11, Points 30.0, Group stage appearances 0, Play-off appearances 1, and AFC Cup appearances 1.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: 1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near 'Rank, Member Association, Points, Group stage, Play-off, AFC Cup) VALUES (11, 'M' at line 1\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `Ranking and Results Table for AFC Cup` (`Rank`, `Member Association`, `Points`, `Group stage`, `Play-off`, `AFC Cup`) VALUES (11, 'Myanmar', 30.0, 0, 1, 1);\"}) The SQL query has a syntax error. It seems that the column names might be causing the issue, possibly due to spaces or special characters. I will adjust the query to ensure proper syntax by using backticks around column names with spaces.\n\nI will execute the following corrected SQL query:\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The values have been successfully inserted into the 'Ranking and Results Table for AFC Cup' table for Myanmar.\"]})"
