I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

This can be achieved using the `MIN()` function in SQL.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('2004',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"2004\"]}) The first title was released in the year 2004.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Tour de France Winners by Stage, and the headers of this table are Year,Stage,Start of stage,Distance (km),Category of climb,Stage winner,Nationality,Yellow jersey,Bend.\nQuestion: The Tour de France Winners by Stage table should be updated with the following data: Year: 1998, Stage: 20, Start of stage: Aix-les-Bains, Distance (km): 149.5, Category of climb: HC, Stage winner: Marco Pantani, Nationality: Italy, Yellow jersey: Marco Pantani, Bend: 25\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `Tour de France Winners by Stage` (Year, Stage, `Start of stage`, `Distance (km)`, `Category of climb`, `Stage winner`, Nationality, `Yellow jersey`, Bend) VALUES (1998, 20, 'Aix-les-Bains', 149.5, 'HC', 'Marco Pantani', 'Italy', 'Marco Pantani', 25);\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The data has been successfully inserted into the Tour de France Winners by Stage table.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Olympic Medals, and the headers of this table are Rank,Nation,Gold,Silver,Bronze,Total.\nQuestion: what is the average number of gold medals won by china, japan, and north korea?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Gold` FROM `Olympic Medals` WHERE Nation IN ('China', 'Japan', 'North Korea');\"}) To calculate the average number of gold medals won by China, Japan, and North Korea, I need to:\n\n1.

Compute the average of these values.\n\nI will start by querying the gold medals for China, Japan, and North Korea. \n\nThe SQL query to execute is:\nTool: [('13',), ('7',), ('1',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"7\"]}) The SQL query returned the number of gold medals for China, Japan, and North Korea as 13, 7, and 1 respectively. \n\nNow, I will calculate the average of these values.\n\nThe average number of gold medals is (13 + 7 + 1) / 3 = 21 / 3 = 7.\n\nI will now commit the final answer."
