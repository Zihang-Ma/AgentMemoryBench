I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

This can be achieved using an `INSERT INTO` SQL statement.\n\nI will now execute the SQL query to insert the data.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO baseball_game_results (Date, Opponent, Score, Loss, Record) VALUES ('Jun 2', '@ Angels', '5–3', 'Montefusco (4–2)', '17–33');\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The data has been successfully inserted into the baseball_game_results table.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Game Records, and the headers of this table are Game,February,Opponent,Score,Record.\nQuestion: Change the February record of Game 62 to 30 in the record database.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Game Records` SET `February` = 30 WHERE `Game` = 62;\"}) The question is asking to update the `February` column to `30` for the row where the `Game` column is `62` in the `Game Records` table. This can be achieved using an `UPDATE` statement with a `WHERE` clause to specify the game number.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The February record for Game 62 has been successfully updated to 30.\"]}) The `February` record for Game 62 has been successfully updated to 30 in the `Game Records` table.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Game Records, and the headers of this table are Game,November,Opponent,Score,Record,Points.\nQuestion: Change the opponent value to 'New York Rangers' for the game with number '30' in the 'Game Records' table.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Game Records` SET `Opponent` = 'New York Rangers' WHERE `Game` = '30';\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The opponent for the game with number '30' has been successfully updated to 'New York Rangers'.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is game score, and the headers of this table are Game,Date,Opponent,Score,Location,Record.\nQuestion: Score of 108-85 is what lowest game?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT MIN(`Game`) AS lowest_game FROM `game score` WHERE `Score` = '108-85';\"}) The question is asking for the lowest game number where the score was \"108-85\". To find this, I need to query the `game score` table for rows where the `Score` is \"108-85\" and then retrieve the minimum value of the `Game` column from those rows. This can be achieved using a `SELECT` statement with the `MIN()` function and a `WHERE` clause to filter the rows with `Score = '108-85'`.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('80',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"80\"]}) The lowest game number with a score of \"108-85\" is 80.\n\nI will now commit the final answer."
