I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

I will query the `Area (km²)` values for both islands and then compare the results.\n\nThe SQL query to execute is:\nTool: [('Tiree', '78'), ('Kasos', '66')]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Tiree\"]}) The query results show that Tiree has an area of 78 km² and Kasos has an area of 66 km². Therefore, Tiree has the most area between the two.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Location Table, and the headers of this table are Location,km,mi,Destinations,Notes.\nQuestion: Insert 'Enfield' into `Location Table` with '30' kilometers, '18.6' miles, and 'Hwy 102 Halifax, Truro To Hwy 104 (TCH) / Hwy 102' as destinations and '-' as notes.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `Location Table` (Location, km, mi, Destinations, Notes) VALUES ('Enfield', '30', '18.6', 'Hwy 102 Halifax, Truro To Hwy 104 (TCH) / Hwy 102', '-');\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The data has been successfully inserted into the Location Table.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Disasters, and the headers of this table are Year,Type,Fatalities,Article,Location,Comments.\nQuestion: Change the year to 2003 for the article related to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami in the Disasters database.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Disasters` SET `Year` = '2003' WHERE `Article` = '2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami';\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The year for the article related to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami has been successfully changed to 2003.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is highest_points, and the headers of this table are Rank,Country,Claimant,Highest point,Height.\nQuestion: What is the highest amount of points for rank 95?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Highest point` FROM `highest_points` WHERE `Rank` = 95;\"}) To find the highest amount of points for rank 95 in the `highest_points` table, I need to query the `Highest point` column where the `Rank` is 95. This can be done using a `SELECT` statement with a `WHERE` clause to filter the rows based on the `Rank` column.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('Đeravica',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Đeravica\"]}) The SQL query returned the result ('Đeravica',), which indicates that the highest amount of points for rank 95 is Đeravica.\n\nI will now commit the final answer."
