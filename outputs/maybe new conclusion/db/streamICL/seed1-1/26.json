I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

Retrieve the number of gold medals for each of these three nations from the `Olympic Medals` table.\n2. Compute the average of these values.\n\nI will start by querying the gold medals for China, Japan, and North Korea. \n\nThe SQL query to execute is:\nTool: [('13',), ('7',), ('1',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"7\"]}) The SQL query returned the number of gold medals for China, Japan, and North Korea as 13, 7, and 1 respectively. \n\nNow, I will calculate the average of these values.\n\nThe average number of gold medals is (13 + 7 + 1) / 3 = 21 / 3 = 7.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Jiu-Jitsu Championships Results, and the headers of this table are Result,Opponent,Method,Event,Notes.\nQuestion: What are the Notes when the Method is decision?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Notes` FROM `Jiu-Jitsu Championships Results` WHERE `Method` = 'decision';\"}) To find the Notes when the Method is 'decision', I need to query the `Notes` column from the `Jiu-Jitsu Championships Results` table where the `Method` column equals 'decision'. This can be done using a `SELECT` statement with a `WHERE` clause to filter the rows based on the specified method.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The Notes when the Method is decision are: \" + \"''\" + \" (no specific notes found in the results).\"]})\nTool: Error: Failed to parse tool call. Tool call format is incorrect.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Notes` FROM `Jiu-Jitsu Championships Results` WHERE `Method` = 'decision';\"})\nTool: [('Women +60kg Bronze',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Women +60kg Bronze\"]}) The Notes when the Method is decision is \"Women +60kg Bronze\".\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Women +60kg Bronze\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Squash Players Ranking, and the headers of this table are Rank,Player Name,No. of Titles,Runner-up,Final Appearances.\nQuestion: which player has the highest number of titles?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Player Name` FROM `Squash Players Ranking` WHERE `No. of Titles` = (SELECT MAX(`No. of Titles`) FROM `Squash Players Ranking`);\"}) To determine which player has the highest number of titles, I need to find the maximum value in the `No. of Titles` column and then identify the player associated with that maximum value. This can be done using the `MAX()` function in SQL along with a `WHERE` clause to filter the player with that maximum number of titles.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('Jansher Khan',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Jansher Khan\"]}) The player with the highest number of titles is Jansher Khan.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Athlete_results, and the headers of this table are Year,Competition,Venue,Position,Event,Notes.\nQuestion: In the table Athlete_results, a row is inserted with the values '2008' for Year, 'Olympic Games' for Competition, 'Beijing, China' for Venue, '1st' for Position, '800 metres' for Event, and '-' for Notes.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `Athlete_results` (Year, Competition, Venue, Position, Event, Notes) VALUES ('2008', 'Olympic Games', 'Beijing, China', '1st', '800 metres', '-');\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The data has been successfully inserted into the Athlete_results table.\"]})"
