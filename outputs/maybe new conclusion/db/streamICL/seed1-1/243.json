I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

Retrieve the `Total` values for Hale Irwin from the `Golf Champions` table.\n2. Calculate the average of these `Total` values.\n\nI will start by querying the `Total` values for Hale Irwin with a T52 finish. \n\nThe SQL query to execute is:\nTool: [('293',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"293\"]}) The SQL query returned the total score of Hale Irwin with a T52 finish as 293. Since there is only one value, the average total is also 293.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Nation Scores Table, and the headers of this table are Nation,T Score,A Score,E Score,Pen.,Total.\nQuestion: France's T Score is now 7.500, A Score is now 7.600, E Score is now 7.200, Pen. is 0.40 and Total is 22.700 in the Nation Scores Table.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Nation Scores Table` SET `T Score` = 7.500, `A Score` = 7.600, `E Score` = 7.200, `Pen.` = 0.40, `Total` = 22.700 WHERE `Nation` = 'France';\"}) To update France's scores in the `Nation Scores Table`, I will use an `UPDATE` SQL statement. This statement will modify the `T Score`, `A Score`, `E Score`, `Pen.`, and `Total` columns for the row where the `Nation` is 'France'.\n\nThe SQL query to execute is:\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The data has been successfully updated in the Nation Scores Table.

Finish` FROM `Racing Stats` WHERE `Position` = 70;\"}) To find the average finish for the position of 70th in the `Racing Stats` table, I need to:\n\n1. Filter the rows in the `Racing Stats` table where the `Position` is 70th.\n2. Retrieve the corresponding `Avg. Finish` value for these rows.\n\nI will start by querying the `Avg. Finish` values for the specified position.\nTool: [('36.0',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"36.0\"]}) The SQL query result shows that the average finish for the position of 70th is 36.0.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Winners By Country, and the headers of this table are Winner,Country,Most Recent Win.\nQuestion: The `Winners By Country` table is being updated by adding the values '3' for `Winner`, 'Spain' for `Country`, and '2005' for `Most Recent Win`.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `Winners By Country` (`Winner`, `Country`, `Most Recent Win`) VALUES (3, 'Spain', 2005);\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The data has been successfully inserted into the Winners By Country table.\"]})"
