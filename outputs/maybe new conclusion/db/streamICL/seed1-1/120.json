I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

This can be done using a `SELECT` statement with a `WHERE` clause to filter the rows based on the specified method.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The Notes when the Method is decision are: \" + \"''\" + \" (no specific notes found in the results).\"]})\nTool: Error: Failed to parse tool call.

Filter the rows in the `Motorcycle Race Results` table where:\n   - `Time/Retired` is \"accident\",\n   - `Manufacturer` is \"Aprilia\", and\n   - `Grid` is 27.\n2. Calculate the average of the `Laps` column for these filtered rows.\n\nI will start by querying the `Laps` values for the specified conditions. \n\nThe SQL query to execute is:\nTool: [('12',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"12\"]}) The SQL query result shows that there is one entry with the specified conditions, and the number of laps is 12. Since there is only one entry, the average number of laps is also 12.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Theatre Performances, and the headers of this table are Year,Title,Role,Notes.\nQuestion: Add a new record to the 'Theatre Performances' table with values '2006' for Year, 'The History Boys' for Title, 'Dakin' for Role, and 'National Theatre' for Notes.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `Theatre Performances` (Year, Title, Role, Notes) VALUES ('2006', 'The History Boys', 'Dakin', 'National Theatre');\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The data has been successfully inserted into the Theatre Performances table.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Grand Prix racing results, and the headers of this table are No,Driver,Entrant,Constructor,Chassis,Engine.\nQuestion: Update the Grand Prix racing results with the following information: Driver Charles Leclerc, Entrant Scuderia Ferrari Mission Winnow, Chassis SF21, and Engine Ferrari 065/6 for the record with No. 16.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Grand Prix racing results` SET `Driver` = 'Charles Leclerc', `Entrant` = 'Scuderia Ferrari Mission Winnow', `Chassis` = 'SF21', `Engine` = 'Ferrari 065/6' WHERE `No` = 16;\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The record with No. 16 in the Grand Prix racing results table has been successfully updated with the new information: Driver Charles Leclerc, Entrant Scuderia Ferrari Mission Winnow, Chassis SF21, and Engine Ferrari 065/6.\"]})"
