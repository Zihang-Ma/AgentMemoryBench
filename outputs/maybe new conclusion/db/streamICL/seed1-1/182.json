I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

This can be achieved using a `SELECT` statement with `WHERE` clauses to filter the rows based on the specified conditions.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('L 97–98 (OT)',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"L 97–98 (OT)\"]}) The score against Portland in game numbers under 20 is \"L 97–98 (OT)\".\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is football_standings, and the headers of this table are Position,Club,Games played,Wins,Draws,Loses,Goals scored,Goals conceded,Points.\nQuestion: What is the fewest number of games played?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT MIN(`Games played`) AS fewest_games FROM football_standings;\"}) To find the fewest number of games played in the `football_standings` table, I need to query the minimum value from the `Games played` column. This can be done using the `MIN()` function in SQL.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('34',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"34\"]}) The fewest number of games played is 34.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Racing Stats, and the headers of this table are Year,Starts,Wins,Top 5,Top 10,Poles,Avg. Start,Avg. Finish,Winnings,Position,Team(s).\nQuestion: Name the avg finish for position of 70th\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Avg. Finish` FROM `Racing Stats` WHERE `Position` = 70;\"}) To find the average finish for the position of 70th in the `Racing Stats` table, I need to:\n\n1. Filter the rows in the `Racing Stats` table where the `Position` is 70th.\n2. Retrieve the corresponding `Avg. Finish` value for these rows.\n\nI will start by querying the `Avg. Finish` values for the specified position.\nTool: [('36.0',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"36.0\"]}) The SQL query result shows that the average finish for the position of 70th is 36.0.\n\nI will now commit the final answer."
