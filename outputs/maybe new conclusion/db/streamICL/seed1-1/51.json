I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

This can be done using the `MIN()` function in SQL.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('34',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"34\"]}) The fewest number of games played is 34.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Player Stats, and the headers of this table are Player,G,Tackles,Solo,Assts,Sacks,Int,Int yards,Int avg.,Int TD,Fum. rec,Fum. rec TD.\nQuestion: Name the least int yards when sacks is 11.5\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT MIN(`Int yards`) AS least_int_yards FROM `Player Stats` WHERE `Sacks` = 11.5;\"}) To find the least `Int yards` when `Sacks` is 11.5, I need to query the `Player Stats` table for rows where `Sacks` equals 11.5 and then retrieve the minimum value of `Int yards` from those rows. This can be achieved using a `SELECT` statement with the `MIN()` function and a `WHERE` clause to filter the rows with `Sacks = 11.5`.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('41',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"41\"]}) The least `Int yards` when `Sacks` is 11.5 is 41.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Squash Players Ranking, and the headers of this table are Rank,Player Name,No. of Titles,Runner-up,Final Appearances.\nQuestion: which player has the highest number of titles?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Player Name` FROM `Squash Players Ranking` WHERE `No. of Titles` = (SELECT MAX(`No. of Titles`) FROM `Squash Players Ranking`);\"}) To determine which player has the highest number of titles, I need to find the maximum value in the `No. of Titles` column and then identify the player associated with that maximum value. This can be done using the `MAX()` function in SQL along with a `WHERE` clause to filter the player with that maximum number of titles.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('Jansher Khan',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Jansher Khan\"]}) The player with the highest number of titles is Jansher Khan.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Dance Competition Results, and the headers of this table are Dance,Best dancer,Best score,Worst dancer,Worst score.\nQuestion: Update the best score of Samba in 'Dance Competition Results' to 42.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Dance Competition Results` SET `Best score` = 42 WHERE `Dance` = 'Samba';\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The best score for Samba in the 'Dance Competition Results' table has been successfully updated to 42.\"]})\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The best score for Samba in the 'Dance Competition Results' table has been successfully updated to 42.\"]})"
