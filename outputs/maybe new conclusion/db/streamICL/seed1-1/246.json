I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

      "content": "Here are some examples of the task you have completed:\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Soccer Team Performance Table, and the headers of this table are Year,Division,League,Regular Season,Playoffs,Open Cup.\nQuestion: other than npsl, what league has ny mens soccer team played in?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `League` FROM `Soccer Team Performance Table` WHERE `Team` = 'NY Men''s Soccer Team';\"}) To find out which league the NY men's soccer team has played in other than the NPSL, I need to query the `Soccer Team Performance Table` for rows where the `League` is not 'NPSL' and the `Team` is 'NY Men's Soccer Team'. Then, I can retrieve the `League` values from those rows.\n\nI will start by checking if there is a record for the 'NY Men's Soccer Team' in the table. If there is, I can then filter out the 'NPSL' league and find the other leagues they have played in.\n\nLet's first check if the 'NY Men's Soccer Team' exists in the table.\nTool: 1054 (42S22): Unknown column 'Team' in 'where clause'\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `League` FROM `Soccer Team Performance Table` WHERE `League` != 'NPSL';\"}) It seems that the `Team` column does not exist in the `Soccer Team Performance Table`. I need to adjust my query to find the leagues that the NY men's soccer team has played in, using the available columns.\n\nLet me try querying the `League` column directly to see if there are any entries related to the NY men's soccer team.\nTool: [('CSL I',), ('CSL I',), ('CSL I',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"CSL I\"]}) It appears that the `Soccer Team Performance Table` contains entries for the 'CSL I' league, but there is no specific mention of the 'NY Men's Soccer Team'. Since the `Team` column is not available, I cannot directly filter for the team. However, based on the information provided, the only league other than 'NPSL' mentioned in the table is 'CSL I'.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Tournament history from 2007-2012, and the headers of this table are Tournament,2007,2008,2009,2010,2011,2012.\nQuestion: Add 'Roland Garros' under 'Tournament history from 2007-2012' and fill the columns 'Q2', 'Q1', 'A', '2R', '1R', 'A' with values.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `Tournament history from 2007-2012` (`Tournament`, `2007`, `2008`, `2009`, `2010`, `2011`, `2012`) VALUES ('Roland Garros', 'Q2', 'Q1', 'A', '2R', '1R', 'A');\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The data has been successfully inserted into the Tournament history from 2007-2012 table.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is football_standings, and the headers of this table are Position,Club,Games played,Wins,Draws,Loses,Goals scored,Goals conceded,Points.\nQuestion: What is the fewest number of games played?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT MIN(`Games played`) AS fewest_games FROM football_standings;\"}) To find the fewest number of games played in the `football_standings` table, I need to query the minimum value from the `Games played` column. This can be done using the `MIN()` function in SQL.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('34',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"34\"]}) The fewest number of games played is 34.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Ranking and Results Table for AFC Cup, and the headers of this table are Rank,Member Association,Points,Group stage,Play-off,AFC Cup.\nQuestion: Insert values into 'Ranking and Results Table for AFC Cup' table for Myanmar with rank 11, 30.0 points, 0 group stage appearances, 1 play-off appearance, and 1 AFC cup appearance.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `Ranking and Results Table for AFC Cup` (Rank, Member Association, Points, Group stage, Play-off, AFC Cup) VALUES (11, 'Myanmar', 30.0, 0, 1, 1);\"}) To insert the specified values into the 'Ranking and Results Table for AFC Cup' table for Myanmar, I will use the `INSERT INTO` SQL statement. The values to be inserted are: Rank 11, Points 30.0, Group stage appearances 0, Play-off appearances 1, and AFC Cup appearances 1.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: 1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near 'Rank, Member Association, Points, Group stage, Play-off, AFC Cup) VALUES (11, 'M' at line 1\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `Ranking and Results Table for AFC Cup` (`Rank`, `Member Association`, `Points`, `Group stage`, `Play-off`, `AFC Cup`) VALUES (11, 'Myanmar', 30.0, 0, 1, 1);\"}) The SQL query has a syntax error. It seems that the column names might be causing the issue, possibly due to spaces or special characters. I will adjust the query to ensure proper syntax by using backticks around column names with spaces.\n\nI will execute the following corrected SQL query:\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The values have been successfully inserted into the 'Ranking and Results Table for AFC Cup' table for Myanmar.\"]})"
