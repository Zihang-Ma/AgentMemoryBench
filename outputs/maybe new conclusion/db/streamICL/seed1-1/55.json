I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

This can be done using the `MAX()` function in SQL along with a `WHERE` clause to filter the player with that maximum number of titles.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('Jansher Khan',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Jansher Khan\"]}) The player with the highest number of titles is Jansher Khan.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Olympic Medal Table, and the headers of this table are Rank,Nation,Gold,Silver,Bronze,Total.\nQuestion: how many nations won no silver medals at all?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `Olympic Medal Table` WHERE `Silver` = 0;\"}) To determine how many nations won no silver medals at all, I need to count the number of rows in the `Olympic Medal Table` where the `Silver` column is equal to 0. This can be done using a `SELECT` statement with a `WHERE` clause to filter the rows based on the `Silver` column and the `COUNT()` function to count the number of such rows.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [(11,)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"11\"]}) The SQL query returned the result (11,), indicating that 11 nations won no silver medals at all.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Olympic Medals, and the headers of this table are Rank,Nation,Gold,Silver,Bronze,Total.\nQuestion: what is the average number of gold medals won by china, japan, and north korea?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Gold` FROM `Olympic Medals` WHERE Nation IN ('China', 'Japan', 'North Korea');\"}) To calculate the average number of gold medals won by China, Japan, and North Korea, I need to:\n\n1. Retrieve the number of gold medals for each of these three nations from the `Olympic Medals` table.\n2. Compute the average of these values.\n\nI will start by querying the gold medals for China, Japan, and North Korea. \n\nThe SQL query to execute is:\nTool: [('13',), ('7',), ('1',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"7\"]}) The SQL query returned the number of gold medals for China, Japan, and North Korea as 13, 7, and 1 respectively. \n\nNow, I will calculate the average of these values.\n\nThe average number of gold medals is (13 + 7 + 1) / 3 = 21 / 3 = 7.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is athlete_performance, and the headers of this table are Year,Competition,Venue,Position,Event,Notes.\nQuestion: Update the athlete's performance data in the 'athlete_performance' table for the '3000 m' event where the athlete finished in '2nd' position.
