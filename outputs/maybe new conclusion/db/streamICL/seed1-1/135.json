I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

Retrieve the number of gold medals for each of these three nations from the `Olympic Medals` table.\n2. Compute the average of these values.\n\nI will start by querying the gold medals for China, Japan, and North Korea. \n\nThe SQL query to execute is:\nTool: [('13',), ('7',), ('1',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"7\"]}) The SQL query returned the number of gold medals for China, Japan, and North Korea as 13, 7, and 1 respectively. \n\nNow, I will calculate the average of these values.\n\nThe average number of gold medals is (13 + 7 + 1) / 3 = 21 / 3 = 7.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Ranking and Results Table for AFC Cup, and the headers of this table are Rank,Member Association,Points,Group stage,Play-off,AFC Cup.\nQuestion: Insert values into 'Ranking and Results Table for AFC Cup' table for Myanmar with rank 11, 30.0 points, 0 group stage appearances, 1 play-off appearance, and 1 AFC cup appearance.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `Ranking and Results Table for AFC Cup` (Rank, Member Association, Points, Group stage, Play-off, AFC Cup) VALUES (11, 'Myanmar', 30.0, 0, 1, 1);\"}) To insert the specified values into the 'Ranking and Results Table for AFC Cup' table for Myanmar, I will use the `INSERT INTO` SQL statement. The values to be inserted are: Rank 11, Points 30.0, Group stage appearances 0, Play-off appearances 1, and AFC Cup appearances 1.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: 1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near 'Rank, Member Association, Points, Group stage, Play-off, AFC Cup) VALUES (11, 'M' at line 1\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `Ranking and Results Table for AFC Cup` (`Rank`, `Member Association`, `Points`, `Group stage`, `Play-off`, `AFC Cup`) VALUES (11, 'Myanmar', 30.0, 0, 1, 1);\"}) The SQL query has a syntax error. It seems that the column names might be causing the issue, possibly due to spaces or special characters. I will adjust the query to ensure proper syntax by using backticks around column names with spaces.\n\nI will execute the following corrected SQL query:\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The values have been successfully inserted into the 'Ranking and Results Table for AFC Cup' table for Myanmar.\"]})"
