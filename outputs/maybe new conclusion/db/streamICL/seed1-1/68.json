I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

This can be done using the `MAX()` function in SQL along with a `WHERE` clause to filter the player with that maximum number of titles.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('Jansher Khan',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Jansher Khan\"]}) The player with the highest number of titles is Jansher Khan.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Hockey Games, and the headers of this table are Round,Date,Home,Result,Visitor,Venue,Attendance.\nQuestion: Which Attendance has a Round of 52, and a Home of södertälje sk?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Attendance` FROM `Hockey Games` WHERE `Round` = 52 AND `Home` = 'södertälje sk';\"}) execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Attendance` FROM `Hockey Games` WHERE `Round` = 52 AND `Home` = 'södertälje sk';\"}) To find the attendance for a game where the round is 52 and the home team is 'södertälje sk', I will use the `SELECT` SQL statement to retrieve the `Attendance` value from the `Hockey Games` table. The `WHERE` clause will filter the rows based on the specified `Round` and `Home` values.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('2,859',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"2,859\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is football_standings, and the headers of this table are Position,Club,Games played,Wins,Draws,Loses,Goals scored,Goals conceded,Points.\nQuestion: What is the fewest number of games played?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT MIN(`Games played`) AS fewest_games FROM football_standings;\"}) To find the fewest number of games played in the `football_standings` table, I need to query the minimum value from the `Games played` column. This can be done using the `MIN()` function in SQL.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('34',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"34\"]}) The fewest number of games played is 34.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Player Stats, and the headers of this table are Player,G,Tackles,Solo,Assts,Sacks,Int,Int yards,Int avg.,Int TD,Fum. rec,Fum. rec TD.\nQuestion: Name the least int yards when sacks is 11.5\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT MIN(`Int yards`) AS least_int_yards FROM `Player Stats` WHERE `Sacks` = 11.5;\"}) To find the least `Int yards` when `Sacks` is 11.5, I need to query the `Player Stats` table for rows where `Sacks` equals 11.5 and then retrieve the minimum value of `Int yards` from those rows. This can be achieved using a `SELECT` statement with the `MIN()` function and a `WHERE` clause to filter the rows with `Sacks = 11.5`.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('41',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"41\"]}) The least `Int yards` when `Sacks` is 11.5 is 41.\n\nI will now commit the final answer."
