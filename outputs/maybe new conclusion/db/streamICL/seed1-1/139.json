I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

This can be achieved using the `MIN()` function in SQL.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('1941',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"1941\"]}) The oldest airline started operations in the year 1941.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Airport Information, and the headers of this table are City,Country,Airport,IATA,ICAO.\nQuestion: Add to 'Airport Information' the city 'Paris', country 'France', airport 'Charles de Gaulle Airport', IATA code 'CDG', and ICAO code 'LFPG'.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `Airport Information` (City, Country, Airport, IATA, ICAO) VALUES ('Paris', 'France', 'Charles de Gaulle Airport', 'CDG', 'LFPG');\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The data has been successfully inserted into the Airport Information table.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Motorcycle Race Results, and the headers of this table are Rider,Manufacturer,Laps,Time/Retired,Grid.\nQuestion: What is the average number of laps with an accident time/retired, aprilia manufacturer and a grid of 27?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Laps` FROM `Motorcycle Race Results` WHERE `Time/Retired` = 'accident' AND `Manufacturer` = 'Aprilia' AND `Grid` = 27;\"}) To find the average number of laps for entries with an \"accident\" time/retired, \"Aprilia\" manufacturer, and a grid of 27, I need to:\n\n1. Filter the rows in the `Motorcycle Race Results` table where:\n   - `Time/Retired` is \"accident\",\n   - `Manufacturer` is \"Aprilia\", and\n   - `Grid` is 27.\n2. Calculate the average of the `Laps` column for these filtered rows.\n\nI will start by querying the `Laps` values for the specified conditions. \n\nThe SQL query to execute is:\nTool: [('12',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"12\"]}) The SQL query result shows that there is one entry with the specified conditions, and the number of laps is 12. Since there is only one entry, the average number of laps is also 12.\n\nI will now commit the final answer."
