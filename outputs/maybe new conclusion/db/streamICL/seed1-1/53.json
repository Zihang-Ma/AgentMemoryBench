I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

      "content": "Here are some examples of the task you have completed:\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is highest_points, and the headers of this table are Rank,Country,Claimant,Highest point,Height.\nQuestion: What is the highest amount of points for rank 95?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Highest point` FROM `highest_points` WHERE `Rank` = 95;\"}) To find the highest amount of points for rank 95 in the `highest_points` table, I need to query the `Highest point` column where the `Rank` is 95. This can be done using a `SELECT` statement with a `WHERE` clause to filter the rows based on the `Rank` column.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('Đeravica',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Đeravica\"]}) The SQL query returned the result ('Đeravica',), which indicates that the highest amount of points for rank 95 is Đeravica.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Squash Players Ranking, and the headers of this table are Rank,Player Name,No. of Titles,Runner-up,Final Appearances.\nQuestion: which player has the highest number of titles?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Player Name` FROM `Squash Players Ranking` WHERE `No. of Titles` = (SELECT MAX(`No. of Titles`) FROM `Squash Players Ranking`);\"}) To determine which player has the highest number of titles, I need to find the maximum value in the `No. of Titles` column and then identify the player associated with that maximum value. This can be done using the `MAX()` function in SQL along with a `WHERE` clause to filter the player with that maximum number of titles.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('Jansher Khan',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Jansher Khan\"]}) The player with the highest number of titles is Jansher Khan.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Motorcycle Race Results, and the headers of this table are Rider,Manufacturer,Laps,Time/Retired,Grid.\nQuestion: What is the average number of laps with an accident time/retired, aprilia manufacturer and a grid of 27?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Laps` FROM `Motorcycle Race Results` WHERE `Time/Retired` = 'accident' AND `Manufacturer` = 'Aprilia' AND `Grid` = 27;\"}) To find the average number of laps for entries with an \"accident\" time/retired, \"Aprilia\" manufacturer, and a grid of 27, I need to:\n\n1. Filter the rows in the `Motorcycle Race Results` table where:\n   - `Time/Retired` is \"accident\",\n   - `Manufacturer` is \"Aprilia\", and\n   - `Grid` is 27.\n2. Calculate the average of the `Laps` column for these filtered rows.\n\nI will start by querying the `Laps` values for the specified conditions. \n\nThe SQL query to execute is:\nTool: [('12',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"12\"]}) The SQL query result shows that there is one entry with the specified conditions, and the number of laps is 12. Since there is only one entry, the average number of laps is also 12.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Golf Champions, and the headers of this table are Player,Country,Year(s) won,Total,To par,Finish.\nQuestion: What is the average total of player hale irwin, who had a t52 finish?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Total` FROM `Golf Champions` WHERE `Player` = 'Hale Irwin' AND `Finish` = 'T52';\"}) To find the average total of player Hale Irwin, who had a T52 finish, I need to:\n\n1. Retrieve the `Total` values for Hale Irwin from the `Golf Champions` table.\n2. Calculate the average of these `Total` values.\n\nI will start by querying the `Total` values for Hale Irwin with a T52 finish. \n\nThe SQL query to execute is:\nTool: [('293',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"293\"]}) The SQL query returned the total score of Hale Irwin with a T52 finish as 293. Since there is only one value, the average total is also 293.\n\nI will now commit the final answer."
