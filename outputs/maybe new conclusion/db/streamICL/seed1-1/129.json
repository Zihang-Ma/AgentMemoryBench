I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

This can be done using the `MIN()` function in SQL.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('34',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"34\"]}) The fewest number of games played is 34.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Game Records, and the headers of this table are Game,November,Opponent,Score,Record,Points.\nQuestion: Change the opponent value to 'New York Rangers' for the game with number '30' in the 'Game Records' table.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Game Records` SET `Opponent` = 'New York Rangers' WHERE `Game` = '30';\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The opponent for the game with number '30' has been successfully updated to 'New York Rangers'.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Team Information, and the headers of this table are Team,Location,Stadium,Capacity.\nQuestion: Modify the capacity of the 'Princeton Tigers' team in the 'Team Information' table to '45,000'.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Team Information` SET `Capacity` = '45,000' WHERE `Team` = 'Princeton Tigers';\"}) To modify the capacity of the 'Princeton Tigers' team in the 'Team Information' table to '45,000', I will use the `UPDATE` SQL statement. This allows me to change the value in the `Capacity` column for the row where the `Team` is 'Princeton Tigers'.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The capacity of the 'Princeton Tigers' team has been successfully updated to '45,000'.\"]}) The capacity of the 'Princeton Tigers' team in the 'Team Information' table has been successfully updated to '45,000'.\n\nI will now commit the final answer."
