I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

This can be achieved using a `SELECT` statement with the `SUM()` function and `WHERE` clauses to filter the rows with the specified `Position` and `Team from`.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [(167.0,)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"167\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Squash Players Ranking, and the headers of this table are Rank,Player Name,No. of Titles,Runner-up,Final Appearances.\nQuestion: which player has the highest number of titles?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Player Name` FROM `Squash Players Ranking` WHERE `No. of Titles` = (SELECT MAX(`No. of Titles`) FROM `Squash Players Ranking`);\"}) To determine which player has the highest number of titles, I need to find the maximum value in the `No. of Titles` column and then identify the player associated with that maximum value. This can be done using the `MAX()` function in SQL along with a `WHERE` clause to filter the player with that maximum number of titles.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('Jansher Khan',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Jansher Khan\"]}) The player with the highest number of titles is Jansher Khan.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is game_results, and the headers of this table are Game,Date,Team,Score,High points,High rebounds,High assists,Location Attendance,Record.\nQuestion: What was the score against Portland in game numbers under 20?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Score` FROM `game_results` WHERE `Game` < 20 AND `Team` = 'Portland';\"}) To find the score against Portland in game numbers under 20, I need to query the `game_results` table for rows where the `Game` number is less than 20 and the `Team` is 'Portland', then retrieve the `Score` value. This can be achieved using a `SELECT` statement with `WHERE` clauses to filter the rows based on the specified conditions.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('L 97–98 (OT)',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"L 97–98 (OT)\"]}) The score against Portland in game numbers under 20 is \"L 97–98 (OT)\".\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Scottish Challenge Cup Finalists, and the headers of this table are Club,Wins,Last final won,Runners-up,Last final lost,Total final appearances.\nQuestion: How manywins for dunfermline athletic that has a total final appearances less than 2?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Wins`, `Total final appearances` FROM `Scottish Challenge Cup Finalists` WHERE `Club` = 'Dunfermline Athletic';\"}) The question is asking for the number of wins for Dunfermline Athletic where their total final appearances are less than 2. To answer this, I will first check if Dunfermline Athletic exists in the `Scottish Challenge Cup Finalists` table and then filter the rows where their `Total final appearances` is less than 2. Finally, I will retrieve the `Wins` value for that club.\n\nI will start by querying the `Wins` and `Total final appearances` for Dunfermline Athletic:\nTool: [('0', '1')]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"0\"]}) The output shows that Dunfermline Athletic has 0 wins and a total of 1 final appearance. Since the total final appearances (1) is less than 2, the number of wins for Dunfermline Athletic under this condition is 0.\n\nI will now commit the final answer."
