I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

Filter the rows in the `Motorcycle Race Results` table where:\n   - `Time/Retired` is \"accident\",\n   - `Manufacturer` is \"Aprilia\", and\n   - `Grid` is 27.\n2. Calculate the average of the `Laps` column for these filtered rows.\n\nI will start by querying the `Laps` values for the specified conditions. \n\nThe SQL query to execute is:\nTool: [('12',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"12\"]}) The SQL query result shows that there is one entry with the specified conditions, and the number of laps is 12. Since there is only one entry, the average number of laps is also 12.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Racing Stats, and the headers of this table are Year,Starts,Wins,Top 5,Top 10,Poles,Avg.

Finish` FROM `Racing Stats` WHERE `Position` = 70;\"}) To find the average finish for the position of 70th in the `Racing Stats` table, I need to:\n\n1.

Finish` values for the specified position.\nTool: [('36.0',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"36.0\"]}) The SQL query result shows that the average finish for the position of 70th is 36.0.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Grand Prix racing results, and the headers of this table are No,Driver,Entrant,Constructor,Chassis,Engine.\nQuestion: Update the Grand Prix racing results with the following information: Driver Charles Leclerc, Entrant Scuderia Ferrari Mission Winnow, Chassis SF21, and Engine Ferrari 065/6 for the record with No. 16.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Grand Prix racing results` SET `Driver` = 'Charles Leclerc', `Entrant` = 'Scuderia Ferrari Mission Winnow', `Chassis` = 'SF21', `Engine` = 'Ferrari 065/6' WHERE `No` = 16;\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The record with No. 16 in the Grand Prix racing results table has been successfully updated with the new information: Driver Charles Leclerc, Entrant Scuderia Ferrari Mission Winnow, Chassis SF21, and Engine Ferrari 065/6.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Formula One Results, and the headers of this table are Year,Entrant,Chassis,Engine,Points.\nQuestion: Update the points to 18 in the Formula One Results table where the year is 2010 and the entrant is Red Bull Racing.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Formula One Results` SET `Points` = 18 WHERE `Year` = 2010 AND `Entrant` = 'Red Bull Racing';\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The points have been successfully updated to 18 in the Formula One Results table for the year 2010 and entrant Red Bull Racing.\"]})"
