I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

This can be done using a `SELECT` statement with a `WHERE` clause to filter the rows based on the `Silver` column and the `COUNT()` function to count the number of such rows.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [(11,)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"11\"]}) The SQL query returned the result (11,), indicating that 11 nations won no silver medals at all.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Winners By Country, and the headers of this table are Winner,Country,Most Recent Win.\nQuestion: The `Winners By Country` table is being updated by adding the values '3' for `Winner`, 'Spain' for `Country`, and '2005' for `Most Recent Win`.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `Winners By Country` (`Winner`, `Country`, `Most Recent Win`) VALUES (3, 'Spain', 2005);\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The data has been successfully inserted into the Winners By Country table.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Olympic Medal Table, and the headers of this table are Rank,Nation,Gold,Silver,Bronze,Total.\nQuestion: Great Britain's bronze count in the Olympic Medal Table is updated to 5 and their total count is incremented by 1.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Olympic Medal Table` SET `Bronze` = 5, `Total` = `Total` + 1 WHERE `Nation` = 'Great Britain';\"}) To update Great Britain's bronze count to 5 and increment their total count by 1 in the `Olympic Medal Table`, I will use an `UPDATE` SQL statement.
