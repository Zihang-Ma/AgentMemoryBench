I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

This can be achieved using a `SELECT` statement with a `WHERE` clause to filter the rows based on the specified condition.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('1,174',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"1,174\"]}) The attendance for tie number 19 is 1,174.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is NFL Team Records Table, and the headers of this table are Num,Team,W,L,PCT,PF,PA,Last appearance,Last championship,HOME games,Home wins,Home losses,Home Win Pct.,ROAD games,Road wins,Road losses,Road Win Pct..\nQuestion: How many home losses occured when PF 13?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT COUNT(`Home losses`) AS home_losses_count FROM `NFL Team Records Table` WHERE `PF` = 13;\"}) The question is asking for the number of home losses that occurred when the \"PF\" (Points For) value is 13. To answer this, I need to query the `NFL Team Records Table` for rows where `PF = 13` and then count the number of entries in the `Home losses` column. This can be achieved using a `SELECT` statement with a `WHERE` clause to filter the rows based on the specified condition and then using the `COUNT()` function to count the number of home losses.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [(1,)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"1\"]}) The query result shows that there is 1 home loss when the \"PF\" (Points For) value is 13.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is AFL Cairns Grand Final Results, and the headers of this table are Year,Premiers,Score,Runners Up,Score.\nQuestion: what team took first place in 2008?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Premiers` FROM `AFL Cairns Grand Final Results` WHERE Year = '2008';\"}) To determine which team took first place in 2008, I need to query the `AFL Cairns Grand Final Results` table for the row where the `Year` is 2008 and then check the `Premiers` column, as it represents the team that took first place.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('Cairns Saints',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Cairns Saints\"]}) The team that took first place in 2008 is Cairns Saints.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is football_standings, and the headers of this table are Position,Club,Games played,Wins,Draws,Loses,Goals scored,Goals conceded,Points.\nQuestion: What is the fewest number of games played?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT MIN(`Games played`) AS fewest_games FROM football_standings;\"}) To find the fewest number of games played in the `football_standings` table, I need to query the minimum value from the `Games played` column. This can be done using the `MIN()` function in SQL.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('34',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"34\"]}) The fewest number of games played is 34.\n\nI will now commit the final answer."
