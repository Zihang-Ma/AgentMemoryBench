I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

Retrieve the number of gold medals for each of these three nations from the `Olympic Medals` table.\n2. Compute the average of these values.\n\nI will start by querying the gold medals for China, Japan, and North Korea. \n\nThe SQL query to execute is:\nTool: [('13',), ('7',), ('1',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"7\"]}) The SQL query returned the number of gold medals for China, Japan, and North Korea as 13, 7, and 1 respectively. \n\nNow, I will calculate the average of these values.\n\nThe average number of gold medals is (13 + 7 + 1) / 3 = 21 / 3 = 7.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Tour de France Winners by Stage, and the headers of this table are Year,Stage,Start of stage,Distance (km),Category of climb,Stage winner,Nationality,Yellow jersey,Bend.\nQuestion: The Tour de France Winners by Stage table should be updated with the following data: Year: 1998, Stage: 20, Start of stage: Aix-les-Bains, Distance (km): 149.5, Category of climb: HC, Stage winner: Marco Pantani, Nationality: Italy, Yellow jersey: Marco Pantani, Bend: 25\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `Tour de France Winners by Stage` (Year, Stage, `Start of stage`, `Distance (km)`, `Category of climb`, `Stage winner`, Nationality, `Yellow jersey`, Bend) VALUES (1998, 20, 'Aix-les-Bains', 149.5, 'HC', 'Marco Pantani', 'Italy', 'Marco Pantani', 25);\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The data has been successfully inserted into the Tour de France Winners by Stage table.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is national films, and the headers of this table are Rank,Country,Box Office,Year,Box office\\\\nfrom national films.\nQuestion: which country received the most box office revenue from national films in 2013?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT MAX(`Box Office`) AS max_box_office FROM `national films` WHERE Year = 2013;\"}) To determine which country received the most box office revenue from national films in 2013, I need to filter the data for the year 2013 and then find the maximum value in the \"Box Office\" column, along with the corresponding \"Country\" value. \n\nI will start by querying the maximum box office revenue for the year 2013. \n\nThe SQL query to execute is:\nTool: [('$3.6 billion',)]\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT Country FROM `national films` WHERE Year = 2013 AND `Box Office` = '$3.6 billion';\"})\nTool: [('China',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"China\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is football_standings, and the headers of this table are Position,Club,Games played,Wins,Draws,Loses,Goals scored,Goals conceded,Points.\nQuestion: What is the fewest number of games played?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT MIN(`Games played`) AS fewest_games FROM football_standings;\"}) To find the fewest number of games played in the `football_standings` table, I need to query the minimum value from the `Games played` column. This can be done using the `MIN()` function in SQL.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('34',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"34\"]}) The fewest number of games played is 34.\n\nI will now commit the final answer."
