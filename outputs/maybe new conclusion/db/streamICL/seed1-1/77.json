I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

      "content": "Here are some examples of the task you have completed:\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Grand Prix racing results, and the headers of this table are No,Driver,Entrant,Constructor,Chassis,Engine.\nQuestion: Update the Grand Prix racing results with the following information: Driver Charles Leclerc, Entrant Scuderia Ferrari Mission Winnow, Chassis SF21, and Engine Ferrari 065/6 for the record with No. 16.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Grand Prix racing results` SET `Driver` = 'Charles Leclerc', `Entrant` = 'Scuderia Ferrari Mission Winnow', `Chassis` = 'SF21', `Engine` = 'Ferrari 065/6' WHERE `No` = 16;\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The record with No. 16 in the Grand Prix racing results table has been successfully updated with the new information: Driver Charles Leclerc, Entrant Scuderia Ferrari Mission Winnow, Chassis SF21, and Engine Ferrari 065/6.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Grand Prix Result, and the headers of this table are Pos,Driver,Entrant,Constructor,Time/Retired,Grid.\nQuestion: who came in earlier, tony maggs or jo siffert?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Driver`, `Pos` FROM `Grand Prix Result` WHERE `Driver` IN ('Tony Maggs', 'Jo Siffert');\"}) To determine who came in earlier between Tony Maggs and Jo Siffert, I need to compare their positions (`Pos`) in the `Grand Prix Result` table. A lower position value indicates a better (earlier) finish. I will first retrieve their positions from the table and then compare them.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query to get their positions:\nTool: [('Tony Maggs', '5'), ('Jo Siffert', '11')]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Tony Maggs\"]}) The SQL query result shows that Tony Maggs came in 5th position and Jo Siffert came in 11th position. Since a lower position value indicates an earlier finish, Tony Maggs came in earlier than Jo Siffert.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is car_racing_schedule, and the headers of this table are Race,Length,Class,Circuit,Date.\nQuestion: Modify the car racing schedule by updating the race of Grand Prix of Atlanta to be classified as Formula 1 and take place at the Atlanta Motor Speedway.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `car_racing_schedule` SET `Class` = 'Formula 1', `Circuit` = 'Atlanta Motor Speedway' WHERE `Race` = 'Grand Prix of Atlanta';\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The race 'Grand Prix of Atlanta' has been successfully updated to be classified as Formula 1 and take place at the Atlanta Motor Speedway.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Jiu-Jitsu Championships Results, and the headers of this table are Result,Opponent,Method,Event,Notes.\nQuestion: What are the Notes when the Method is decision?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Notes` FROM `Jiu-Jitsu Championships Results` WHERE `Method` = 'decision';\"}) To find the Notes when the Method is 'decision', I need to query the `Notes` column from the `Jiu-Jitsu Championships Results` table where the `Method` column equals 'decision'. This can be done using a `SELECT` statement with a `WHERE` clause to filter the rows based on the specified method.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The Notes when the Method is decision are: \" + \"''\" + \" (no specific notes found in the results).\"]})\nTool: Error: Failed to parse tool call. Tool call format is incorrect.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Notes` FROM `Jiu-Jitsu Championships Results` WHERE `Method` = 'decision';\"})\nTool: [('Women +60kg Bronze',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Women +60kg Bronze\"]}) The Notes when the Method is decision is \"Women +60kg Bronze\".\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Women +60kg Bronze\"]})"
