I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

To find this, I need to query the `raiders_game_stats` table for rows where `Game` is 9 and then count the unique values in the `Raiders first downs` column. This can be achieved using a `SELECT` statement with the `COUNT(DISTINCT)` function and a `WHERE` clause to filter the rows with `Game = 9`.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [(1,)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"1\"]}) The query result shows that there is 1 distinct count of `Raiders first downs` for game number 9. \n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Grand Prix racing results, and the headers of this table are No,Driver,Entrant,Constructor,Chassis,Engine.\nQuestion: Update the Grand Prix racing results with the following information: Driver Charles Leclerc, Entrant Scuderia Ferrari Mission Winnow, Chassis SF21, and Engine Ferrari 065/6 for the record with No. 16.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Grand Prix racing results` SET `Driver` = 'Charles Leclerc', `Entrant` = 'Scuderia Ferrari Mission Winnow', `Chassis` = 'SF21', `Engine` = 'Ferrari 065/6' WHERE `No` = 16;\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The record with No. 16 in the Grand Prix racing results table has been successfully updated with the new information: Driver Charles Leclerc, Entrant Scuderia Ferrari Mission Winnow, Chassis SF21, and Engine Ferrari 065/6.\"]})"
