I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

This allows me to modify the value in the `Position` column for the row where the `Footballer` is \"Andile Jali\".\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Andile Jali's position has been successfully updated to DF in the Footballers table.\"]}) The position of Andile Jali in the Footballers table has been successfully updated to \"DF\".\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Player Stats, and the headers of this table are Player,G,Tackles,Solo,Assts,Sacks,Int,Int yards,Int avg.,Int TD,Fum. rec,Fum. rec TD.\nQuestion: Name the least int yards when sacks is 11.5\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT MIN(`Int yards`) AS least_int_yards FROM `Player Stats` WHERE `Sacks` = 11.5;\"}) To find the least `Int yards` when `Sacks` is 11.5, I need to query the `Player Stats` table for rows where `Sacks` equals 11.5 and then retrieve the minimum value of `Int yards` from those rows. This can be achieved using a `SELECT` statement with the `MIN()` function and a `WHERE` clause to filter the rows with `Sacks = 11.5`.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('41',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"41\"]}) The least `Int yards` when `Sacks` is 11.5 is 41.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Game Statistics, and the headers of this table are Game,Date,Team,Score,High points,High rebounds,High assists,Location Attendance,Series.\nQuestion: Update the game statistics for game 9 by setting the high points to 'Dan Majerle (28)' and the high rebounds to 'Charles Barkley (15)'.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Game Statistics` SET `High points` = 'Dan Majerle (28)', `High rebounds` = 'Charles Barkley (15)' WHERE `Game` = 9;\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The game statistics for game 9 have been successfully updated with High points = 'Dan Majerle (28)' and High rebounds = 'Charles Barkley (15)'.\"]})"
