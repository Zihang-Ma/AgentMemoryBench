I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

Filter the rows in the `Motorcycle Race Results` table where:\n   - `Time/Retired` is \"accident\",\n   - `Manufacturer` is \"Aprilia\", and\n   - `Grid` is 27.\n2. Calculate the average of the `Laps` column for these filtered rows.\n\nI will start by querying the `Laps` values for the specified conditions. \n\nThe SQL query to execute is:\nTool: [('12',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"12\"]}) The SQL query result shows that there is one entry with the specified conditions, and the number of laps is 12. Since there is only one entry, the average number of laps is also 12.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Tour de France Winners by Stage, and the headers of this table are Year,Stage,Start of stage,Distance (km),Category of climb,Stage winner,Nationality,Yellow jersey,Bend.\nQuestion: The Tour de France Winners by Stage table should be updated with the following data: Year: 1998, Stage: 20, Start of stage: Aix-les-Bains, Distance (km): 149.5, Category of climb: HC, Stage winner: Marco Pantani, Nationality: Italy, Yellow jersey: Marco Pantani, Bend: 25\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `Tour de France Winners by Stage` (Year, Stage, `Start of stage`, `Distance (km)`, `Category of climb`, `Stage winner`, Nationality, `Yellow jersey`, Bend) VALUES (1998, 20, 'Aix-les-Bains', 149.5, 'HC', 'Marco Pantani', 'Italy', 'Marco Pantani', 25);\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The data has been successfully inserted into the Tour de France Winners by Stage table.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is football_standings, and the headers of this table are Position,Club,Games played,Wins,Draws,Loses,Goals scored,Goals conceded,Points.\nQuestion: What is the fewest number of games played?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT MIN(`Games played`) AS fewest_games FROM football_standings;\"}) To find the fewest number of games played in the `football_standings` table, I need to query the minimum value from the `Games played` column. This can be done using the `MIN()` function in SQL.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('34',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"34\"]}) The fewest number of games played is 34.\n\nI will now commit the final answer."
