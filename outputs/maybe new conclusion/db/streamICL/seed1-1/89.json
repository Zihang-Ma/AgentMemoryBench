I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

This can be achieved using the `MIN()` function in SQL.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('1941',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"1941\"]}) The oldest airline started operations in the year 1941.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Jiu-Jitsu Championships Results, and the headers of this table are Result,Opponent,Method,Event,Notes.\nQuestion: What are the Notes when the Method is decision?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Notes` FROM `Jiu-Jitsu Championships Results` WHERE `Method` = 'decision';\"}) To find the Notes when the Method is 'decision', I need to query the `Notes` column from the `Jiu-Jitsu Championships Results` table where the `Method` column equals 'decision'. This can be done using a `SELECT` statement with a `WHERE` clause to filter the rows based on the specified method.\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The Notes when the Method is decision are: \" + \"''\" + \" (no specific notes found in the results).\"]})\nTool: Error: Failed to parse tool call. Tool call format is incorrect.\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Notes` FROM `Jiu-Jitsu Championships Results` WHERE `Method` = 'decision';\"})\nTool: [('Women +60kg Bronze',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Women +60kg Bronze\"]}) The Notes when the Method is decision is \"Women +60kg Bronze\".\nUser: Internal error: No tool calls found despite finish reason.\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Women +60kg Bronze\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Motorcycle Race Results, and the headers of this table are Rider,Manufacturer,Laps,Time/Retired,Grid.\nQuestion: What is the average number of laps with an accident time/retired, aprilia manufacturer and a grid of 27?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Laps` FROM `Motorcycle Race Results` WHERE `Time/Retired` = 'accident' AND `Manufacturer` = 'Aprilia' AND `Grid` = 27;\"}) To find the average number of laps for entries with an \"accident\" time/retired, \"Aprilia\" manufacturer, and a grid of 27, I need to:\n\n1. Filter the rows in the `Motorcycle Race Results` table where:\n   - `Time/Retired` is \"accident\",\n   - `Manufacturer` is \"Aprilia\", and\n   - `Grid` is 27.\n2. Calculate the average of the `Laps` column for these filtered rows.\n\nI will start by querying the `Laps` values for the specified conditions. \n\nThe SQL query to execute is:\nTool: [('12',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"12\"]}) The SQL query result shows that there is one entry with the specified conditions, and the number of laps is 12. Since there is only one entry, the average number of laps is also 12.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Music Releases, and the headers of this table are Release,Artist,Title,Notes,Album.\nQuestion: what year was the first title released?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT MIN(`Release`) AS first_release_year FROM `Music Releases`;\"}) To find the year the first title was released, I need to identify the minimum value in the `Release` column of the `Music Releases` table. This can be achieved using the `MIN()` function in SQL.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('2004',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"2004\"]}) The first title was released in the year 2004.\n\nI will now commit the final answer."
