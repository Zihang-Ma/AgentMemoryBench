I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

A lower position value indicates a better (earlier) finish. I will first retrieve their positions from the table and then compare them.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query to get their positions:\nTool: [('Tony Maggs', '5'), ('Jo Siffert', '11')]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Tony Maggs\"]}) The SQL query result shows that Tony Maggs came in 5th position and Jo Siffert came in 11th position. Since a lower position value indicates an earlier finish, Tony Maggs came in earlier than Jo Siffert.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Athlete Results, and the headers of this table are Year,Competition,Venue,Position,Event,Notes.\nQuestion: Insert into table 'Athlete Results' with values '2012', 'Olympic Games', 'London, UK', 'Pole vault', '12th', '5.50 m'.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `Athlete Results` (Year, Competition, Venue, Event, Position, Notes) VALUES ('2012', 'Olympic Games', 'London, UK', 'Pole vault', '12th', '5.50 m');\"}) The task is to insert a new row into the `Athlete Results` table with the specified values: '2012' for Year, 'Olympic Games' for Competition, 'London, UK' for Venue, 'Pole vault' for Event, '12th' for Position, and '5.50 m' for Notes.
