I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

This can be achieved using the `MIN()` function in SQL.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('2004',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"2004\"]}) The first title was released in the year 2004.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Squash Players Ranking, and the headers of this table are Rank,Player Name,No. of Titles,Runner-up,Final Appearances.\nQuestion: which player has the highest number of titles?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Player Name` FROM `Squash Players Ranking` WHERE `No. of Titles` = (SELECT MAX(`No. of Titles`) FROM `Squash Players Ranking`);\"}) To determine which player has the highest number of titles, I need to find the maximum value in the `No. of Titles` column and then identify the player associated with that maximum value. This can be done using the `MAX()` function in SQL along with a `WHERE` clause to filter the player with that maximum number of titles.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('Jansher Khan',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Jansher Khan\"]}) The player with the highest number of titles is Jansher Khan.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is hockey_players, and the headers of this table are Pick #,Player,Nationality,Position,Team from,League from.\nQuestion: What is the total pick # for the D position from a team from Chilliwack Bruins?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT SUM(`Pick #`) AS total_pick FROM hockey_players WHERE `Position` = 'D' AND `Team from` = 'Chilliwack Bruins';\"}) To find the total pick # for the D position from a team from Chilliwack Bruins, I need to query the `hockey_players` table for rows where `Position` is 'D' and `Team from` is 'Chilliwack Bruins', and then sum the values in the `Pick #` column. This can be achieved using a `SELECT` statement with the `SUM()` function and `WHERE` clauses to filter the rows with the specified `Position` and `Team from`.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [(167.0,)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"167\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Hockey_Game_Results, and the headers of this table are Date,Winning Team,Score,Losing Team,Score,OT,City,State/Province,Arena,Attendance.\nQuestion: did dallas or ottawa win the december 9, 1993 game?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Winning Team` FROM `Hockey_Game_Results` WHERE Date = 'December 9, 1993';\"}) To determine whether Dallas or Ottawa won the game on December 9, 1993, I need to query the `Hockey_Game_Results` table for the game on that date and check which team is listed as the `Winning Team`.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('Dallas',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Dallas\"]}) The winning team on December 9, 1993, was Dallas.\n\nI will now commit the final answer."
