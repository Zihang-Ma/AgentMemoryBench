I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

This can be achieved using a `SELECT` statement with `WHERE` clauses to filter the rows based on the specified conditions.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('L 97–98 (OT)',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"L 97–98 (OT)\"]}) The score against Portland in game numbers under 20 is \"L 97–98 (OT)\".\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is hockey_players, and the headers of this table are Pick #,Player,Nationality,Position,Team from,League from.\nQuestion: What is the total pick # for the D position from a team from Chilliwack Bruins?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT SUM(`Pick #`) AS total_pick FROM hockey_players WHERE `Position` = 'D' AND `Team from` = 'Chilliwack Bruins';\"}) To find the total pick # for the D position from a team from Chilliwack Bruins, I need to query the `hockey_players` table for rows where `Position` is 'D' and `Team from` is 'Chilliwack Bruins', and then sum the values in the `Pick #` column. This can be achieved using a `SELECT` statement with the `SUM()` function and `WHERE` clauses to filter the rows with the specified `Position` and `Team from`.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [(167.0,)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"167\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Squash Players Ranking, and the headers of this table are Rank,Player Name,No. of Titles,Runner-up,Final Appearances.\nQuestion: which player has the highest number of titles?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Player Name` FROM `Squash Players Ranking` WHERE `No. of Titles` = (SELECT MAX(`No. of Titles`) FROM `Squash Players Ranking`);\"}) To determine which player has the highest number of titles, I need to find the maximum value in the `No. of Titles` column and then identify the player associated with that maximum value. This can be done using the `MAX()` function in SQL along with a `WHERE` clause to filter the player with that maximum number of titles.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('Jansher Khan',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Jansher Khan\"]}) The player with the highest number of titles is Jansher Khan.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Footballers, and the headers of this table are Season,Footballer,Club,Position,Nationality.\nQuestion: Change Andile Jali's position to DF in the Footballers table.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"UPDATE `Footballers` SET `Position` = 'DF' WHERE `Footballer` = 'Andile Jali';\"}) To change Andile Jali's position to \"DF\" in the Footballers table, I will use the `UPDATE` SQL statement. This allows me to modify the value in the `Position` column for the row where the `Footballer` is \"Andile Jali\".\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Andile Jali's position has been successfully updated to DF in the Footballers table.\"]}) The position of Andile Jali in the Footballers table has been successfully updated to \"DF\".\n\nI will now commit the final answer."
