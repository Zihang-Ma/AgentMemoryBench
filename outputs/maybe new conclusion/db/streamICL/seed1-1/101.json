I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

This can be achieved using a `SELECT` statement with a `WHERE` clause to filter the rows based on the specified condition.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('1,174',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"1,174\"]}) The attendance for tie number 19 is 1,174.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Schools, and the headers of this table are Institution,Location,Affiliation,Enrollment,Mascot,Colors.\nQuestion: Insert into Schools table with values including Institution as 'Aquinas', Location as 'La Crosse', Affiliation as 'Private', Enrollment as '312', Mascot as 'Blugolds', and Colors as 'Navy and gold'.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `Schools` (Institution, Location, Affiliation, Enrollment, Mascot, Colors) VALUES ('Aquinas', 'La Crosse', 'Private', '312', 'Blugolds', 'Navy and gold');\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The data has been successfully inserted into the Schools table.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Theatre Performances, and the headers of this table are Year,Title,Role,Notes.\nQuestion: Add a new record to the 'Theatre Performances' table with values '2006' for Year, 'The History Boys' for Title, 'Dakin' for Role, and 'National Theatre' for Notes.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `Theatre Performances` (Year, Title, Role, Notes) VALUES ('2006', 'The History Boys', 'Dakin', 'National Theatre');\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The data has been successfully inserted into the Theatre Performances table.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Olympic Medal Table, and the headers of this table are Rank,Nation,Gold,Silver,Bronze,Total.\nQuestion: how many nations won no silver medals at all?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `Olympic Medal Table` WHERE `Silver` = 0;\"}) To determine how many nations won no silver medals at all, I need to count the number of rows in the `Olympic Medal Table` where the `Silver` column is equal to 0. This can be done using a `SELECT` statement with a `WHERE` clause to filter the rows based on the `Silver` column and the `COUNT()` function to count the number of such rows.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [(11,)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"11\"]}) The SQL query returned the result (11,), indicating that 11 nations won no silver medals at all.\n\nI will now commit the final answer."
