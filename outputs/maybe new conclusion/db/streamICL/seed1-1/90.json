This can be achieved using a `SELECT` statement with a `WHERE` clause to filter the rows based on the specified condition.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('1,174',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"1,174\"]}) The attendance for tie number 19 is 1,174.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is football_matches, and the headers of this table are Home team,Home team score,Away team,Away team score,Venue,Crowd,Date.\nQuestion: What is the smallest crowd number for a team that has an Away team score of 15.11 (101)?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT MIN(`Crowd`) AS smallest_crowd FROM football_matches WHERE `Away team score` = '15.11 (101)';\"}) The question is asking for the smallest crowd number in the `football_matches` table where the `Away team score` is \"15.11 (101)\". To find this, I need to query the `Crowd` column for rows where `Away team score` equals \"15.11 (101)\" and then retrieve the minimum value of the `Crowd` column from those rows. This can be achieved using a `SELECT` statement with the `MIN()` function and a `WHERE` clause to filter the rows with `Away team score = '15.11 (101)'`.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('16,000',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"16,000\"]}) The smallest crowd number for a team with an Away team score of \"15.11 (101)\" is 16,000. \n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is football_standings, and the headers of this table are Position,Club,Games played,Wins,Draws,Loses,Goals scored,Goals conceded,Points.\nQuestion: What is the fewest number of games played?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT MIN(`Games played`) AS fewest_games FROM football_standings;\"}) To find the fewest number of games played in the `football_standings` table, I need to query the minimum value from the `Games played` column. This can be done using the `MIN()` function in SQL.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('34',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"34\"]}) The fewest number of games played is 34.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Soccer Team Performance Table, and the headers of this table are Year,Division,League,Regular Season,Playoffs,Open Cup.\nQuestion: other than npsl, what league has ny mens soccer team played in?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `League` FROM `Soccer Team Performance Table` WHERE `Team` = 'NY Men''s Soccer Team';\"}) To find out which league the NY men's soccer team has played in other than the NPSL, I need to query the `Soccer Team Performance Table` for rows where the `League` is not 'NPSL' and the `Team` is 'NY Men's Soccer Team'. Then, I can retrieve the `League` values from those rows.\n\nI will start by checking if there is a record for the 'NY Men's Soccer Team' in the table. If there is, I can then filter out the 'NPSL' league and find the other leagues they have played in.\n\nLet's first check if the 'NY Men's Soccer Team' exists in the table.\nTool: 1054 (42S22): Unknown column 'Team' in 'where clause'\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `League` FROM `Soccer Team Performance Table` WHERE `League` != 'NPSL';\"}) It seems that the `Team` column does not exist in the `Soccer Team Performance Table`. I need to adjust my query to find the leagues that the NY men's soccer team has played in, using the available columns.\n\nLet me try querying the `League` column directly to see if there are any entries related to the NY men's soccer team.\nTool: [('CSL I',), ('CSL I',), ('CSL I',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"CSL I\"]}) It appears that the `Soccer Team Performance Table` contains entries for the 'CSL I' league, but there is no specific mention of the 'NY Men's Soccer Team'. Since the `Team` column is not available, I cannot directly filter for the team. However, based on the information provided, the only league other than 'NPSL' mentioned in the table is 'CSL I'.\n\nI will now commit the final answer."
