I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

This can be done using the `MAX()` function in SQL along with a `WHERE` clause to filter the player with that maximum number of titles.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('Jansher Khan',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Jansher Khan\"]}) The player with the highest number of titles is Jansher Khan.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is football_standings, and the headers of this table are Position,Club,Games played,Wins,Draws,Loses,Goals scored,Goals conceded,Points.\nQuestion: What is the fewest number of games played?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT MIN(`Games played`) AS fewest_games FROM football_standings;\"}) To find the fewest number of games played in the `football_standings` table, I need to query the minimum value from the `Games played` column. This can be done using the `MIN()` function in SQL.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('34',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"34\"]}) The fewest number of games played is 34.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Ranking and Results Table for AFC Cup, and the headers of this table are Rank,Member Association,Points,Group stage,Play-off,AFC Cup.\nQuestion: Insert values into 'Ranking and Results Table for AFC Cup' table for Myanmar with rank 11, 30.0 points, 0 group stage appearances, 1 play-off appearance, and 1 AFC cup appearance.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `Ranking and Results Table for AFC Cup` (Rank, Member Association, Points, Group stage, Play-off, AFC Cup) VALUES (11, 'Myanmar', 30.0, 0, 1, 1);\"}) To insert the specified values into the 'Ranking and Results Table for AFC Cup' table for Myanmar, I will use the `INSERT INTO` SQL statement. The values to be inserted are: Rank 11, Points 30.0, Group stage appearances 0, Play-off appearances 1, and AFC Cup appearances 1.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: 1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near 'Rank, Member Association, Points, Group stage, Play-off, AFC Cup) VALUES (11, 'M' at line 1\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `Ranking and Results Table for AFC Cup` (`Rank`, `Member Association`, `Points`, `Group stage`, `Play-off`, `AFC Cup`) VALUES (11, 'Myanmar', 30.0, 0, 1, 1);\"}) The SQL query has a syntax error. It seems that the column names might be causing the issue, possibly due to spaces or special characters. I will adjust the query to ensure proper syntax by using backticks around column names with spaces.\n\nI will execute the following corrected SQL query:\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The values have been successfully inserted into the 'Ranking and Results Table for AFC Cup' table for Myanmar.\"]})\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Tour de France Winners by Stage, and the headers of this table are Year,Stage,Start of stage,Distance (km),Category of climb,Stage winner,Nationality,Yellow jersey,Bend.\nQuestion: The Tour de France Winners by Stage table should be updated with the following data: Year: 1998, Stage: 20, Start of stage: Aix-les-Bains, Distance (km): 149.5, Category of climb: HC, Stage winner: Marco Pantani, Nationality: Italy, Yellow jersey: Marco Pantani, Bend: 25\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `Tour de France Winners by Stage` (Year, Stage, `Start of stage`, `Distance (km)`, `Category of climb`, `Stage winner`, Nationality, `Yellow jersey`, Bend) VALUES (1998, 20, 'Aix-les-Bains', 149.5, 'HC', 'Marco Pantani', 'Italy', 'Marco Pantani', 25);\"})\nTool: []\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"The data has been successfully inserted into the Tour de France Winners by Stage table.\"]})"
