I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

This can be done using the `MIN()` function in SQL.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('34',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"34\"]}) The fewest number of games played is 34.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Ranking and Results Table for AFC Cup, and the headers of this table are Rank,Member Association,Points,Group stage,Play-off,AFC Cup.\nQuestion: Insert values into 'Ranking and Results Table for AFC Cup' table for Myanmar with rank 11, 30.0 points, 0 group stage appearances, 1 play-off appearance, and 1 AFC cup appearance.\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"INSERT INTO `Ranking and Results Table for AFC Cup` (Rank, Member Association, Points, Group stage, Play-off, AFC Cup) VALUES (11, 'Myanmar', 30.0, 0, 1, 1);\"}) To insert the specified values into the 'Ranking and Results Table for AFC Cup' table for Myanmar, I will use the `INSERT INTO` SQL statement.
