I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

This can be done using the `MAX()` function in SQL along with a `WHERE` clause to filter the player with that maximum number of titles.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('Jansher Khan',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Jansher Khan\"]}) The player with the highest number of titles is Jansher Khan.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Olympic Medal Table, and the headers of this table are Rank,Nation,Gold,Silver,Bronze,Total.\nQuestion: how many nations won no silver medals at all?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `Olympic Medal Table` WHERE `Silver` = 0;\"}) To determine how many nations won no silver medals at all, I need to count the number of rows in the `Olympic Medal Table` where the `Silver` column is equal to 0. This can be done using a `SELECT` statement with a `WHERE` clause to filter the rows based on the `Silver` column and the `COUNT()` function to count the number of such rows.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [(11,)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"11\"]}) The SQL query returned the result (11,), indicating that 11 nations won no silver medals at all.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is football_standings, and the headers of this table are Position,Club,Games played,Wins,Draws,Loses,Goals scored,Goals conceded,Points.\nQuestion: What is the fewest number of games played?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT MIN(`Games played`) AS fewest_games FROM football_standings;\"}) To find the fewest number of games played in the `football_standings` table, I need to query the minimum value from the `Games played` column. This can be done using the `MIN()` function in SQL.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('34',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"34\"]}) The fewest number of games played is 34.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Golf Champions, and the headers of this table are Player,Country,Year(s) won,Total,To par,Finish.\nQuestion: What is the average total of player hale irwin, who had a t52 finish?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Total` FROM `Golf Champions` WHERE `Player` = 'Hale Irwin' AND `Finish` = 'T52';\"}) To find the average total of player Hale Irwin, who had a T52 finish, I need to:\n\n1. Retrieve the `Total` values for Hale Irwin from the `Golf Champions` table.\n2. Calculate the average of these `Total` values.\n\nI will start by querying the `Total` values for Hale Irwin with a T52 finish. \n\nThe SQL query to execute is:\nTool: [('293',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"293\"]}) The SQL query returned the total score of Hale Irwin with a T52 finish as 293. Since there is only one value, the average total is also 293.\n\nI will now commit the final answer."
