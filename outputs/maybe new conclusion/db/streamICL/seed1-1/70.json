I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer. Be careful not to write it in the content field.\nYour input will be raw MySQL response, you have to deal with it by yourself."

This can be achieved using a `SELECT` statement with a `WHERE` clause to filter the rows based on the specified condition.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('1,174',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"1,174\"]}) The attendance for tie number 19 is 1,174.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is AFL Cairns Grand Final Results, and the headers of this table are Year,Premiers,Score,Runners Up,Score.\nQuestion: what team took first place in 2008?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Premiers` FROM `AFL Cairns Grand Final Results` WHERE Year = '2008';\"}) To determine which team took first place in 2008, I need to query the `AFL Cairns Grand Final Results` table for the row where the `Year` is 2008 and then check the `Premiers` column, as it represents the team that took first place.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('Cairns Saints',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Cairns Saints\"]}) The team that took first place in 2008 is Cairns Saints.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Scottish Challenge Cup Finalists, and the headers of this table are Club,Wins,Last final won,Runners-up,Last final lost,Total final appearances.\nQuestion: How manywins for dunfermline athletic that has a total final appearances less than 2?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Wins`, `Total final appearances` FROM `Scottish Challenge Cup Finalists` WHERE `Club` = 'Dunfermline Athletic';\"}) The question is asking for the number of wins for Dunfermline Athletic where their total final appearances are less than 2. To answer this, I will first check if Dunfermline Athletic exists in the `Scottish Challenge Cup Finalists` table and then filter the rows where their `Total final appearances` is less than 2. Finally, I will retrieve the `Wins` value for that club.\n\nI will start by querying the `Wins` and `Total final appearances` for Dunfermline Athletic:\nTool: [('0', '1')]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"0\"]}) The output shows that Dunfermline Athletic has 0 wins and a total of 1 final appearance. Since the total final appearances (1) is less than 2, the number of wins for Dunfermline Athletic under this condition is 0.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is raiders_game_stats, and the headers of this table are Game,Date,Opponent,Result,Raiders points,Opponents,Raiders first downs,Record,Attendance.\nQuestion: How many different counts of the Raiders first downs are there for the game number 9?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT `Raiders first downs`) AS distinct_first_downs FROM `raiders_game_stats` WHERE `Game` = 9;\"}) The question is asking for the number of distinct values in the `Raiders first downs` column for the game number 9. To find this, I need to query the `raiders_game_stats` table for rows where `Game` is 9 and then count the unique values in the `Raiders first downs` column. This can be achieved using a `SELECT` statement with the `COUNT(DISTINCT)` function and a `WHERE` clause to filter the rows with `Game = 9`.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [(1,)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"1\"]}) The query result shows that there is 1 distinct count of `Raiders first downs` for game number 9. \n\nI will now commit the final answer."
