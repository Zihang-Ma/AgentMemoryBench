I will only execute the statement in the first SQL code block. Every time you write a SQL, I will execute it for you and give you the output.\nIf you are done operating, and you want to commit your final answer, then use the `commit_final_answer` function.\nDO NOT use this tool unless you are sure about your answer. I expect an accurate and correct answer.\nYour answer should be accurate. Your answer must be exactly the same as the correct answer.\nIf the question is about modifying the database, then after done operation, your answer field can be anything.\nIf your response cannot match any pattern I mentioned earlier, you will be judged as FAIL immediately.\nYou should always use the tools provided to submit your answer.

This can be done using the `MAX()` function in SQL along with a `WHERE` clause to filter the player with that maximum number of titles.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('Jansher Khan',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"Jansher Khan\"]}) The player with the highest number of titles is Jansher Khan.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Football Matches, and the headers of this table are Tie no,Home team,Score,Away team,Attendance.\nQuestion: How many attended tie number 19?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Attendance` FROM `Football Matches` WHERE `Tie no` = 19;\"}) To find the attendance for tie number 19, I need to query the `Football Matches` table for the row where `Tie no` is 19 and then retrieve the `Attendance` value. This can be achieved using a `SELECT` statement with a `WHERE` clause to filter the rows based on the specified condition.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('1,174',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"1,174\"]}) The attendance for tie number 19 is 1,174.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Basketball Players, and the headers of this table are No,Player,Height,Position,Year born,Current Club.\nQuestion: What is the earliest any of these players were born?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT MIN(`Year born`) AS earliest_year FROM `Basketball Players`;\"}) To find the earliest birth year among the players in the `Basketball Players` table, I need to query the `Year born` column and retrieve the minimum value. This can be achieved using the `MIN()` function in SQL.\n\nI will execute the following SQL query:\nTool: [('1976',)]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"1976\"]}) The earliest any of these players were born is 1976.\n\nI will now commit the final answer.\n\n\nQuestion: Additional table information about the question: The name of this table is Scottish Challenge Cup Finalists, and the headers of this table are Club,Wins,Last final won,Runners-up,Last final lost,Total final appearances.\nQuestion: How manywins for dunfermline athletic that has a total final appearances less than 2?\n\nAssistant: execute_sql({\"query\": \"SELECT `Wins`, `Total final appearances` FROM `Scottish Challenge Cup Finalists` WHERE `Club` = 'Dunfermline Athletic';\"}) The question is asking for the number of wins for Dunfermline Athletic where their total final appearances are less than 2. To answer this, I will first check if Dunfermline Athletic exists in the `Scottish Challenge Cup Finalists` table and then filter the rows where their `Total final appearances` is less than 2. Finally, I will retrieve the `Wins` value for that club.\n\nI will start by querying the `Wins` and `Total final appearances` for Dunfermline Athletic:\nTool: [('0', '1')]\nAssistant: commit_final_answer({\"answers\": [\"0\"]}) The output shows that Dunfermline Athletic has 0 wins and a total of 1 final appearance. Since the total final appearances (1) is less than 2, the number of wins for Dunfermline Athletic under this condition is 0.\n\nI will now commit the final answer."
